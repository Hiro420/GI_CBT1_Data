DialogData_TalkContent_3521702	There will definitely be someone who knows something about your {MATEAVATAR#SEXPRO[INFO_MALE_PRONOUN_BROTHER|INFO_FEMALE_PRONOUN_SISTER]}. At least, that's what I think!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3521702	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3521702	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3521703	Of course, whether the Archons actually answer is an entirely different question. You'll never know unless you try.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3521703	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3521703	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3521704	So, let's hop to it!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3521704	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3521704	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3520301	You can <color=#00E1FFFF>swim</color> right over!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3520301	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3520301	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3520501	Hey! Where are you going? Come to Paimon!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3520501	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3520501	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3520601	You should <color=#00E1FFFF>follow Paimon</color> for now.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3520601	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3520601	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3520701	Don't stray too far from Paimon!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3520701	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3520701	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3521001	Can we visit those places later?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3521001	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3521001	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3521002	Alright then.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3521002	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3521002	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3532801	Ooh! Did you just feel the elements of the world?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3532801	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3532801	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3532802	Seems all you had to do was just to touch the statue, and you got the power of Anemo!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3532802	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3532802	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3532803	People in this world can never get hold of powers as effortless as you...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3532803	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3532803	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3532804	This power comes from... It's from...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3532804	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3532804	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3532805	A-ha, because you are not from this world to begin with.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3532805	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3532805	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3532807	This can't be good...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3532807	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3532807	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3532808	It's a bit rude to say that about the power the Archons just gave you!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3532808	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3532808	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3532809	If we keep heading west from here, we will eventually reach Mondstadt, the City of Freedom.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3532809	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3532809	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3532817	Mondstadt is the city of Wind, because they worship the Anemo Archon.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3532817	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3532817	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3532810	So perhaps, because you got power from the Anemo Archon, you can find some clues there.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3532810	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3532810	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3532811	There's also lots of bards there, so perhaps one of them has heard news of your {MATEAVATAR#SEXPRO[INFO_MALE_PRONOUN_BROTHER|INFO_FEMALE_PRONOUN_SISTER]}.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3532811	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3532811	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3532812	Let's move, then!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3532812	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3532812	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3532813	The elements in this world responded to your prayers and I think that's a lovely sign.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3532813	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3532813	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3532901	Under strange skies, {MATEAVATAR#SEXPRO[INFO_MALE_PRONOUN_BOY|INFO_FEMALE_PRONOUN_GIRL]} stands amongst shifting sands...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3532901	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3532901	Mysterious Voice
DialogData_TalkContent_3532902	The light {MATEAVATAR#SEXPRO[INFO_MALE_PRONOUN_HE|INFO_FEMALE_PRONOUN_SHE]} holds most dear is not of the Archons, but of what drifted here from worlds away. 
DialogData_TalkTitle_3532902	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3532902	Mysterious Voice
DialogData_TalkContent_3532903	That light diminished in the Honkai collapse, and the sad memory was lost amongst the cries.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3532903	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3532903	Mysterious Voice
DialogData_TalkContent_3532904	But there is no need for lamenting the bygone memories of bones and flesh, for humans are never truly alone. On a certain windy night...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3532904	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3532904	Mysterious Voice
DialogData_TalkContent_3532905	Kin that were once separated shall be reunited in Mondstadt.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3532905	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3532905	Mysterious Voice

DialogData_TalkTitle_3530502	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3530502	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3530503	These are the Anemo powers you just received from the Statue of the Seven.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3530503	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3530503	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3530504	Aww... I'm so jealous. I wish I had cool fighting powers!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3530504	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3530504	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3610000	Whoa, what is that!?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3610000	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3610000	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3610001	There is something huge... in the sky!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3610001	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3610001	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3610002	It's heading towards the heart of the forest. We must proceed with caution.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3610002	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3610002	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3550001	Ah? Take a look at that!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3550001	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3550001	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3550002	...Don't be afraid.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3550002	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3550002	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3550003	...It's alright now, I'm back.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3550003	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3550003	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3550004	Is he talking... to a dragon?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3550004	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3550004	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3550005	Oh?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3550005	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3550005	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3550006	 
DialogData_TalkTitle_3550006	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3550006	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3550007	Who's there!?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3550007	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3550007	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3550008	 
DialogData_TalkTitle_3550008	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3550008	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3550009	 
DialogData_TalkTitle_3550009	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3550009	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3550701	That was close! I almost got blown away!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3550701	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3550701	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3550702	Luckily, I managed to grab hold of your hair! Thanks.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3550702	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3550702	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3550703	Good thing you didn't pull my hair out.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3550703	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3550703	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3550704	Good thing the dragon didn't notice us.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3550704	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3550704	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3550705	Just what was that? I thought we were gonna get eaten.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3550705	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3550705	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3550706	It definitely has something to do with that weirdo who was talking to the dragon...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3550706	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3550706	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3550707	I can't believe dragons exist in this world...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3550707	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3550707	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3550708	Yeah, I get why you're worried...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3550708	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3550708	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3550709	Is talking to dragons normal?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3550709	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3550709	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3550710	Of course not!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3550710	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3550710	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3550711	Oh? What's that?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3550711	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3550711	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3550712	There's some kind of shiny red thingy on the big rock over there...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3550712	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3550712	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3550713	Let's go take a closer look.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3550713	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3550713	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3550501	Be careful! I don't have a good feeling about this...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3550501	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3550501	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3550601	I've never seen a stone like this before, so I can't tell what it is.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3550601	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3550601	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3550602	All I know is that it's dangerous. Better we put it away for now.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3550602	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3550602	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3550603	Ok, we've got it! Now let's get out of here.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3550603	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3550603	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3540002	Hey! You! Stop right there!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3540002	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3540002	???
DialogData_TalkContent_3540401	May the Anemo Archon protect you, stranger!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3540401	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3540401	???
DialogData_TalkContent_3540402	I am Amber, an Outrider of the Knights of Favonius.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3540402	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3540402	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3540403	You don't look like citizens of Mondstadt. Explain yourselves!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3540403	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3540403	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3540404	We're not looking for trouble.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3540404	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3540404	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3540405	That's what all the suspicious-looking people say.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3540405	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3540405	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3540406	Hello, I'm {NICKNAME}.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3540406	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3540406	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3540407	...Doesn't sound like a local name to me.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3540407	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3540407	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3540408	And this... mascot, what's the deal with it?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3540408	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3540408	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3540409	We're friends.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3540409	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3540409	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3540410	I mean, we've only been traveling partners for two months, but yeah...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3540410	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3540410	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3540411	We've already become the best of friends!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3540411	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3540411	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3540412	Emergency food.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3540412	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3540412	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3540413	Hey! That's even worse than being a mascot!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3540413	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3540413	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3540414	So to sum it up, you're traveling partners, right?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3540414	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3540414	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3540415	There's been a large dragon sighted around Mondstadt recently. Best you get inside the city as soon as possible.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3540415	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3540415	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3540416	It's not far from here, I'll escort you there.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3540416	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3540416	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3540417	Oh? Did you not leave the city for some other tasks?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3540417	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3540417	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3540418	I did. But not to worry, I can keep you both safe while doing that too.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3540418	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3540418	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3540419	Besides... I'm still not sure if I can trust you two just yet!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3540419	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3540419	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3540420	Seems like you don't particularly trust us.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3540420	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3540420	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3540421	That's a rather rude way to speak to guests.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3540421	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3540421	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3540422	Oh, ahh... I'm sorry. Probably not something I should say as a knight.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3540422	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3540422	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3540423	I give you my apologies, ugh... strange yet... respectable travelers.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3540423	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3540423	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3540424	That sounded so fake!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3540424	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3540424	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3540425	Do you have something against the type of language usage prescribed by the Knights of Favonius Handbook!?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3540425	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3540425	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3540217	So, dodgy travelers, what are you doing in Mondstadt?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3540217	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3540217	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3540218	{NICKNAME} got separated from {MATEAVATAR#SEXPRO[INFO_MALE_PRONOUN_BROTHER|INFO_FEMALE_PRONOUN_SISTER]} during a really really long journey.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3540218	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3540218	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3540219	I'm {MATEAVATAR#SEXPRO[INFO_MALE_PRONOUN_HE|INFO_FEMALE_PRONOUN_SHE]}'s traveling partner, accompanying {MATEAVATAR#SEXPRO[INFO_MALE_PRONOUN_HE|INFO_FEMALE_PRONOUN_SHE]} in search of {MATEAVATAR#SEXPRO[INFO_MALE_PRONOUN_BROTHER|INFO_FEMALE_PRONOUN_SISTER]}.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3540219	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3540219	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3540220	Oh, looking for your family... huh.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3540220	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3540220	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3540221	...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3540221	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3540221	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3540222	Oh! Wait for me to finish my other stuff first, and then I can help you put up posters around the city...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3540222	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3540222	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3540223	What exactly is it you need to finish doing first?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3540223	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3540223	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3540224	It's simple. You'll understand in a bit.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3540224	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3540224	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3600001	Agh! A Hilichurl!?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3600001	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3600001	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3600004	Don't let it get away!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3600004	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3600004	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3600002	These wild monsters have been getting a bit too close to the city recently.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3600002	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3600002	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3600005	My task, on this occasion, is to clear out their camp.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3600005	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3600005	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3600003	As I thought, that Hilichurl came from here.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3600003	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3600003	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3600006	I'm going to clear out this joint!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3600006	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3600006	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3600101	Heh, nothing to it.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3600101	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3600101	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3600102	Though I've gotta say, you surprised me a little with your moves there...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3600102	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3600102	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3600103	Thanks for the back up just now. How'd it feel?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3600103	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3600103	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3600104	Easy breezy.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3600104	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3600104	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3600105	Was harder than I expected.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3600105	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3600105	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3600106	Now that you mention it, how is it that the Hilichurl ended up showing up here?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3600106	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3600106	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3600107	These creatures don't seem to ever set up camp so close to cities like this.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3600107	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3600107	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3600108	Exactly. It's normal for them to be much further out in the wilderness.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3600108	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3600108	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3600109	But because Stormterror has been around a lot more recently, the orchards have been destroyed and the market has been affected as well.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3600109	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3600109	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3600110	When the storms hit, we usually end up with at least a few injuries, so the Knights of Favonius have been dispatched to defend the area.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3600110	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3600110	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3600111	So these nuisance creatures have been getting closer and closer to the city?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3600111	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3600111	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3600112	That's it. That said, there were a few goods to gain from this camp.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3600112	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3600112	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3600113	Come with me! A responsible knight must make sure to see you to the city safely.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3600113	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3600113	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3560101	Let me officially introduce the city of wind, dandelions, and freedom——
DialogData_TalkTitle_3560101	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3560101	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3560102	Travelers under the protection of the Knights of Favonius, welcome to Mondstadt!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3560102	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3560102	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3560103	Finally, no more having to camp outdoors!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3560103	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3560103	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3560104	But the city folk don't look too cheery.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3560104	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3560104	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3560105	Because everyone's been put out of place by Stormterror recently.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3560105	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3560105	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3560106	Everything will turn out fine as long as Jean's with us!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3560106	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3560106	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3560107	Jean?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3560107	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3560107	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3560108	Acting Grandmaster of the Knights of Favonius — Jean, Defender of Mondstadt.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3560108	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3560108	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3560109	With Jean on our side, surely even the vicious Stormterror will be no match for us.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3560109	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3560109	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3560110	(Sounds like someone pretty impressive...)
DialogData_TalkTitle_3560110	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3560110	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3560111	(I hope she knows something about the Anemo Archon)
DialogData_TalkTitle_3560111	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3560111	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3560112	Before I take you guys to the headquarters of the Knights of Favonius, I have a present for {NICKNAME}.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3560112	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3560112	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3560113	It's a reward for helping me clear out that Hilichurl camp.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3560113	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3560113	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3560114	He-Hey! Why don't I get a reward?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3560114	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3560114	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3560115	Ahh... Because it's something useless to you Paimon.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3560115	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3560115	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3560116	But I'll treat you to a traditional Mondstadt delicacy, Sticky Honey Carrot Meat.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3560116	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3560116	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3560117	Sticky Honey Carrot Meat!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3560117	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3560117	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3560118	Come with me for now, we'll head to the city's... high ground.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3560118	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3560118	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3560202	It used to be a bustling street... Recently, due to the attacks of Stormterror, the usual merchants and travelers are nowhere to be seen.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3560202	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3560202	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3560203	Except for the tavern in the corner, they haven't been affected. If anything, their business is better than ever.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3560203	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3560203	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3560401	And the present I spoke of is——
DialogData_TalkTitle_3560401	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3560401	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3560402	A wind glider!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3560402	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3560402	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3560403	Outriders use them to move through the air, and the people of Mondstadt love using them too.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3560403	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3560403	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3560404	I brought you here to give it to you so you can experience it right away!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3560404	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3560404	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3560405	She really wants you to use it, huh!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3560405	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3560405	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3560406	Well, that's because the wind is the heart and soul of Mondstadt!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3560406	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3560406	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3560407	Alrighty then, enough talk, let's give the glider a whirl!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3560407	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3560407	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3560408	The controls are easy but you still have to follow my instructions.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3560408	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3560408	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3571001	I think we've arrived at the <color=#00E1FFFF>Knights of Favonius</color>. Let's head in.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3571001	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3571001	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3572100	
DialogData_TalkTitle_3572100	
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3572100	
DialogData_TalkContent_3572101	You okay?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3572101	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3572101	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3572106	
DialogData_TalkTitle_3572106	
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3572106	
DialogData_TalkContent_3572102	Wow, you've actually got the power to go up against the dragon...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3572102	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3572102	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3572103	Are you our guest... or a new storm?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3572103	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3572103	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3572104	
DialogData_TalkTitle_3572104	
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3572104	
DialogData_TalkContent_3572105	
DialogData_TalkTitle_3572105	
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3572105	
DialogData_TalkContent_3572201	How did...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3572201	
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3572201	
DialogData_TalkContent_3572202	
DialogData_TalkTitle_3572202	
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3572202	
DialogData_TalkContent_3572203	
DialogData_TalkTitle_3572203	
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3572203	
DialogData_TalkContent_3572204	
DialogData_TalkTitle_3572204	
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3572204	
DialogData_TalkContent_3572205	
DialogData_TalkTitle_3572205	
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3572205	
DialogData_TalkContent_3572206	
DialogData_TalkTitle_3572206	
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3572206	
DialogData_TalkContent_3572301	Stormterror... is attacking the inner city directly!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3572301	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3572301	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3572302	Kaeya, {NICKNAME}, you've come at the right time. We must...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3572302	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3572302	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3572303	Hold up, Amber. Are you perhaps forgetting to introduce us?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3572303	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3572303	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3572304	Oh... right. This is Kaeya, our Quartermaster. 
DialogData_TalkTitle_3572304	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3572304	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3572305	These two are travelers from afar, {NICKNAME} and Paimon.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3572305	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3572305	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3572306	(From afar? Is that all we know of them?)
DialogData_TalkTitle_3572306	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3572306	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3572307	Long story short...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3572307	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3572307	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3572308	I see. Welcome to Mondstadt, though you haven't arrived at the best of times, I'm afraid.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3572308	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3572308	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3572309	I understand the anguish of being separated from family.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3572309	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3572309	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3572310	Although, I'm not sure why you're looking for the Anemo Archon...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3572310	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3572310	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3572311	But everyone has their secrets, right?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3572311	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3572311	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3572312	Relax! I won't press you for more.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3572312	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3572312	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3572313	All in all, I would like to thank you on behalf of the Knights of Favonius.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3572313	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3572313	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3572314	We can't leave a disaster like that to fester.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3572314	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3572314	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3572315	You're welcome! So... ah... where's the reward?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3572315	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3572315	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3572316	Umm... How about a traditional Mondstadt delicacy, Sticky Honey Carrot Meat?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3572316	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3572316	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3572317	I've just heard about that one!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3572317	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3572317	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3572318	The fight to defend the city against the dragon just now was witnessed by no small number of citizens.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3572318	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3572318	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3572319	The Acting Grandmaster of the Knights of Favonius is also very interested in meeting, and extends her invitation to you both.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3572319	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3572319	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3570900	 
DialogData_TalkTitle_3570900	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3570900	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3570901	Jean, you couldn't wait? I thought we agreed to meet {PLAYERAVATAR#SEXPRO[INFO_MALE_PRONOUN_HE|INFO_FEMALE_PRONOUN_SHE]} here?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3570901	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3570901	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3570902	There've been sightings of Stormterror outside the city. After meeting {PLAYERAVATAR#SEXPRO[INFO_MALE_PRONOUN_HE|INFO_FEMALE_PRONOUN_SHE]}, I'd like to...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3570902	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3570902	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3570903	Relax. I'll lend a hand when the time comes.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3570903	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3570903	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3570904	Ma'am, I have brought them here.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3570904	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3570904	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3570905	 
DialogData_TalkTitle_3570905	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3570905	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3580101	...And that's how everything happened.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3580101	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3580101	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3580102	Mondstadt welcomes you and the wind that brought you here.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3580102	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3580102	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3580103	I am Jean, Acting Grandmaster of the Knights of Favonius. This is Lisa, our resident Librarian.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3580103	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3580103	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3580104	Oh! Are you sweeties here to help us out?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3580104	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3580104	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3580105	You're both so adorable.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3580105	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3580105	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3580106	Sadly, the timing is regrettable...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3580106	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3580106	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3580107	Stormterror's recent resurgence and activity in the area has really put a damper on things for us.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3580107	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3580107	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3580108	Mondstadt's elemental sphere and ley lines both look like they've been torn apart like a kitten at a ball of wool right now.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3580108	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3580108	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3580109	For a magician it couldn't get much worse. My skin is one elemental particle away from a full-blown break out.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3580109	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3580109	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3580110	If it weren't for this interference, the Knights of Favonius would have better ways to help you than just putting up missing person posters.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3580110	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3580110	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3580111	We simply ask that you stay in Mondstadt for a while so we can try and get this sorted for you.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3580111	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3580111	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3580112	Well we can't just leave it up to you guys.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3580112	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3580112	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3580113	Paimon will help too!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3580113	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3580113	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3580114	Guess we leave it up to you then. Where's the inn?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3580114	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3580114	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3580115	Hey! Don't be lazy! We should be a part of this too!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3580115	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3580115	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3580116	Ok, in that case we need to sort a battle plan.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3580116	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3580116	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3580117	With Stormterror now directly attacking Mondstadt, we may have been presented with an opportunity to put an end to the destruction.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3580117	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3580117	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3580118	Thanks to Lisa's magical detection, the storms bearing down on us have given up their origin.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3580118	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3580118	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3580119	Oh? Then where are they coming from?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3580119	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3580119	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3580120	From within the Four Winds Temples.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3580120	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3580120	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3580121	Stormterror's ability to whip up these kinds of storms can be attributed to it drawing power from the temples.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3580121	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3580121	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3580122	Our objective is to deal with three of the four temples.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3580122	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3580122	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3580123	I trust everyone understands why we're only dealing with three.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3580123	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3580123	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3580124	Paimon doesn't.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3580124	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3580124	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3580125	It must be a local thing...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3580125	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3580125	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3580126	We'll ask later...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3580126	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3580126	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3580127	Knights of Favonius, time is against us.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3580127	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3580127	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3580128	The storms are getting stronger. Simply maintaining a defensive tactic isn't doing us any good.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3580128	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3580128	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3580129	We need to make a move on these temples before the situation gets any worse.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3580129	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3580129	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3060301	Want to team up with me? I should warn you though, I don't slow down for anyone, greenhorn or otherwise.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3060301	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3060301	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3060302	Jean seems to be pretty reliable.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3060302	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3060302	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3060303	With Jean by our side, nothing can stand in our way! ...At least, that's what I wanna say...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3060303	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3060303	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3060304	But I can't keep spouting the same old line.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3060304	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3060304	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3060305	She always dashes headstrong into the heart of the battle, and we want her to take better care of herself.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3060305	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3060305	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3060306	I really hope that one day I can confidently say that Jean doesn't need to worry anymore, because we have her back...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3060306	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3060306	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3060307	Ask about gliders.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3060307	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3060307	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3060308	As a novice within the Knights of Favonius, your understanding of the wind is absolutely crucial.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3060308	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3060308	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3060309	Leave the advanced wind glider training to me!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3060309	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3060309	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3060310	Goodbye.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3060310	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3060310	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3060311	Let's all do our best to defeat Stormterror!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3060311	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3060311	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3061101	This is it. One of the deserted temples of the Four Winds.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3061101	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3061101	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3061102	These temples have been left to waste for years now. The people of Mondstadt almost never come here.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3061102	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3061102	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3061103	There's a chance there's a monster nest or Hilichurl camp inside.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3061103	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3061103	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3061104	Even Stormterror has given up on its own temple.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3061104	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3061104	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3061105	Did you just say "Stormterror"...?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3061105	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3061105	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3061106	Did you just say "Its own temple"...?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3061106	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3061106	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3061107	...Yes.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3061107	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3061107	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3061108	I also find it hard to accept, but... Stormterror was once one of The Four Winds.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3061108	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3061108	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3061109	Ehhhh!?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3061109	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3061109	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3061110	Wait... Did you just feel that?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3061110	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3061110	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3061111	The wind here... Something's off...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3061111	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3061111	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3061112	Go in and take a look, {NICKNAME}. Be careful, the dragon's power is disturbing this area.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3061112	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3061112	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3061001	Phew, I'm tired.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3061001	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3061001	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3061002	But, at least this way we've helped Jean out.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3061002	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3061002	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3061003	In the past, we were at least able to defend the city and keep it safe.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3061003	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3061003	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3061004	This is, of course, mostly thanks to Jean.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3061004	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3061004	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3061005	But now with Stormterror directly attacking the city itself...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3061005	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3061005	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3061006	"The winds change, so too should our tactics."
DialogData_TalkTitle_3061006	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3061006	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3061007	Sounds deep.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3061007	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3061007	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3061008	Did you come up with it?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3061008	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3061008	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3061009	It's what Lisa likes to say.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3061009	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3061009	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3061010	Speaking of which, the Four Winds we were discussing earlier——
DialogData_TalkTitle_3061010	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3061010	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3061011	If you want to learn more about our history, you can ask Lisa.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3061011	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3061011	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3061012	...I'm not saying I don't know our history! It's just...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3061012	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3061012	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3061013	I mean... A librarian is supposed to be more knowledgeable than an Outrider!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3061013	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3061013	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3070301	You are pretty good with the glider. Where did you learn how to use it?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3070301	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3070301	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3070302	Your eye patch?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3070302	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3070302	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3070303	My eye patch? Wanna hear my story, eh?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3070303	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3070303	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3070304	I didn't have the time to do a proper self introduction... Well, it wasn't in my mind to begin with, actually.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3070304	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3070304	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3070305	My bad, heh. I'm Quartermaster Kaeya.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3070305	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3070305	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3070306	We can talk after we get things done.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3070306	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3070306	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3070307	I know a great place more fit for a chat.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3070307	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3070307	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3070308	Why is Jean the Acting Grandmaster?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3070308	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3070308	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3070309	The Grandmaster is on a long-term leave, so the responsibility of running the Knights now falls on the Master, Jean.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3070309	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3070309	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3070310	And this is how Jean received the title Acting Grandmaster.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3070310	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3070310	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3070311	When the Grandmaster left, he also took four-fifths of our knights with him, so what is left for the Acting Grandmaster is five times the responsibility and stress.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3070311	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3070311	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3070312	Come to think of it, it must have been difficult for Jean.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3070312	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3070312	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3070313	Goodbye.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3070313	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3070313	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3070314	See you later then.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3070314	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3070314	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3071101	You have come.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3071101	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3071101	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3071102	Come closer. Can you smell it?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3071102	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3071102	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3071103	...I smell nothing.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3071103	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3071103	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3071104	It's the smell of burnt slimes.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3071104	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3071104	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3071105	Something happened in the temple.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3071105	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3071105	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3071106	Slimes, Hilichurls, and... remains of Stormterror's magical powers.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3071106	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3071106	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3071107	It must have been bustling with lives in there.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3071107	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3071107	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3071108	Will it be dangerous?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3071108	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3071108	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3071109	As bustling as it was, no, it won't be much of a danger.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3071109	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3071109	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3071110	Nothing more than a disorderly mob of creatures.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3071110	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3071110	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3071111	Oh! What courageous words!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3071111	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3071111	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3071112	A pity that the Temple of the Wolf of the North now is disturbed by such atrocity.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3071112	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3071112	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3071113	Let's move, {MATEAVATAR#SEXPRO[INFO_MALE_PRONOUN_BOY|INFO_FEMALE_PRONOUN_GIRL]}.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3071113	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3071113	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3071114	No one offers sacrifice to the Four Winds anymore, yet the olden winds will never vanish...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3071114	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3071114	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3071115	Now we must go clear the surroundings for our Four Winds.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3071115	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3071115	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3071201	Let me show you how the Knights of Favonius conquer our adversaries!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3071201	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3071201	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3071501	Bravo! What a fight!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3071501	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3071501	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3071502	You are, to my surprise, a well-trained knight.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3071502	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3071502	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3071503	The battles you fought in the temple were sights to behold.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3071503	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3071503	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3071504	Thanks, that's nice of you to say...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3071504	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3071504	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3071505	Not worth complimenting really...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3071505	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3071505	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3071506	*Chuckles* I see you already have the knightly virtues of "modesty."
DialogData_TalkTitle_3071506	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3071506	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3071507	Your heroic deeds to free Mondstadt from destruction shall spread throughout the City of Freedom in the future.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3071507	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3071507	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3071508	Please do visit me at our headquarters when you have the time.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3071508	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3071508	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3071509	I also know a lovely tavern, if that's more of your thing.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3071509	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3071509	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3071309	Quite rewarding, no?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3071309	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3071309	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3071310	We have successfully seized a ruin from Stormterror's grasp!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3071310	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3071310	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3071311	It's my job to deal with the aftermath. You can go take care of other things while I'm at it.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3071311	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3071311	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3071312	See you later then!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3071312	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3071312	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3071313	I don't believe that the Hilichurls could plan an ambush by themselves with their pathetic cerebral capabilities.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3071313	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3071313	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3071314	 
DialogData_TalkTitle_3071314	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3071314	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3071315	You were the mastermind, that's why.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3071315	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3071315	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3071316	Gohus, Chiso Vonph
DialogData_TalkTitle_3071316	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3071316	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3071317	 
DialogData_TalkTitle_3071317	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3071317	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3071318	Knights of Favonius, you are even more inefficient than I imagined.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3071318	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3071318	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3071319	It's fine. Your involvement in this just made things a lot more interesting.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3071319	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3071319	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3080301	I'm Lisa, the librarian. Do you need anything, cutie?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3080301	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3080301	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3080302	About monsters.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3080302	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3080302	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3080303	About the monsters in the fields? We've got many resources here.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3080303	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3080303	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3080304	Making good use of the elemental reaction is the key to wining any battle.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3080304	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3080304	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3080305	By the way, are you interested in getting a part-time job here?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3080305	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3080305	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3080306	We need a handyman... I mean, someone to support us.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3080306	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3080306	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3080307	About Stormterror.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3080307	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3080307	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3080308	A way to fight against Stormterror...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3080308	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3080308	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3080309	I'm sorry, but there's no way to do it alone.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3080309	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3080309	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3080310	Judging by the power of Anemo it holds, it's definitely not an ordinary creature.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3080310	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3080310	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3080311	I could teach you some basics in the elements, so you'll have an idea of what I'm talking about.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3080311	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3080311	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3080312	Goodbye.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3080312	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3080312	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3080313	Heading out? See you in a bit.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3080313	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3080313	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3081101	Hey, cutie.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3081101	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3081101	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3081102	You're here to help out too? How nice of you.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3081102	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3081102	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3081103	Don't hesitate to come to me if you need anything.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3081103	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3081103	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3081104	What kind of things does a librarian do?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3081104	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3081104	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3081105	Good question.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3081105	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3081105	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3081106	Basically, things other than brawn and brains.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3081106	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3081106	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3081107	So what's left...?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3081107	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3081107	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3081108	Why would a librarian be at the ruins...?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3081108	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3081108	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3081109	Good question.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3081109	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3081109	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3081110	Well, because Jean trusts me.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3081110	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3081110	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3081111	So you should as well.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3081111	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3081111	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3081201	I need to give it a good go too.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3081201	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3081201	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3081401	Dragon of the East, Lion of the South, Wolf of the North, Falcon of the West...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3081401	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3081401	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3081402	They are the Four Winds of Mondstadt, affiliated with Barbatos, the Anemo Archon.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3081402	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3081402	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3081403	Dvalin. That's Stormterror's real name.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3081403	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3081403	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3081404	Before it became "Stormterror," it was the Dragon of the East.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3081404	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3081404	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3081405	So now you know why Dvalin is only able to use three of the four Four Winds' powers——
DialogData_TalkTitle_3081405	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3081405	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3081406	because it has been consuming itself from the beginning.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3081406	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3081406	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3081407	Why?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3081407	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3081407	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3081408	Why would it go to such lengths?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3081408	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3081408	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3081409	Because of hatred, I presume.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3081409	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3081409	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3081410	Hatred...?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3081410	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3081410	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3081411	Hatred toward Mondstadt.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3081411	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3081411	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3081412	Its hatred drove it to become something more powerful than the wind itself — to become Stormterror.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3081412	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3081412	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3081413	But why would one of the Four Winds...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3081413	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3081413	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3081414	Hate the city it was supposed to protect?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3081414	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3081414	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3081415	...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3081415	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3081415	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3081416	It's an embarrassment for a child of Mondstadt to tell.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3081416	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3081416	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3081417	Here, read it yourself. It happened centuries ago.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3081417	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3081417	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3090201	Now, it's finally done.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3090201	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3090201	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3090202	Well now, hopefully, Mondstadt's elemental and ley line flow are back to normal.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3090202	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3090202	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3090203	Go back and see how the Knights are doing?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3090203	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3090203	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3090204	But if you got anything more interesting to do, I don't mind accompanying ya!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3090204	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3090204	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3090205	Like... going on a shopping spree... or checking out the Statue of The Seven again.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3090205	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3090205	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3090206	At the temple of the Four Winds, we got something like Anemo rocks or gems, didn't we?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3090206	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3090206	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3090207	In Mondstadt, people call it a "Statue's Eye of Wind."
DialogData_TalkTitle_3090207	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3090207	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3090208	It can be fitted into the statue's eyes.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3090208	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3090208	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3090209	Some stories say a swallow took its original eye-gems.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3090209	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3090209	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3090210	But Statue's Eye of Wind never had physical forms from the start.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3090210	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3090210	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3090211	That kinda elemental energy is difficult to be sensed by most. It wouldn't change the statue's appearance even when sacrificed.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3090211	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3090211	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3090212	People with Visions collect them for the Statue of The Seven to get blessings.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3090212	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3090212	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3090213	Although you don't have a Vision, the rules of this world don't apply to you...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3090213	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3090213	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3090214	We can go right now if you want to try.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3090214	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3090214	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3090215	The Statue at Windrise should be the closest statue.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3090215	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3090215	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3090216	I can't wait to see how the Archons respond to ya!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3090216	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3090216	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3090301	Thank you for accepting our invitation, traveler.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3090301	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3090301	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3090302	About Stormterror.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3090302	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3090302	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3090303	The change of its size and power really is suspicious.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3090303	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3090303	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3090304	But for the Knights of Favonius, our priority is to settle down the aftermath of this attack.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3090304	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3090304	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3090305	The Grandmaster entrusted the Knights of Favonius to me. I can't let him or the people of Mondstat down.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3090305	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3090305	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3090306	I must find out the truth...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3090306	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3090306	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3090307	Before coming into the city
DialogData_TalkTitle_3090307	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3090307	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3090308	I heard Outrider Amber and you had a misunderstanding. *smiles*
DialogData_TalkTitle_3090308	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3090308	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3090309	Please forgive her. She was just doing her job.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3090309	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3090309	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3090310	Talk to Amber sometimes. I'm sure you'll like how energetic she always is.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3090310	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3090310	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3090311	Goodbye.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3090311	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3090311	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3090312	Thanks for your help again, {NICKNAME}.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3090312	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3090312	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3090401	Phew, I'm finally done.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3090401	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3090401	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3090402	Well now, hopefully, Mondstadt's elemental and ley line flow are back to normal.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3090402	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3090402	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3090403	Go back and see how the Knights are doing?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3090403	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3090403	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3090404	But if you got anything more interesting to do, I don't mind accompanying ya!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3090404	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3090404	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3090405	By the way, we obtained another "Lost Statue's Eye of Wind" in the Temple of Four Winds, right?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3090405	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3090405	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3090406	We might come across more of them in the future, so don't forget their use!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3090406	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3090406	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3091101	The winds are too powerful!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3091101

DialogData_TalkTitle_3091201

DialogData_TalkContent_3700102	Thanks to your help, the flows of elements are finally stable.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700102	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700102	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700103	The aftermath of Stormterror's last attack is finally at an end for the moment.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700103	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700103	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700104	...*nods*
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700104	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700104	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700105	However, the pressure from the <color=#00E1FFFF>delegation</color> has become too huge to be ignored.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700105	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700105	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700106	Delegation?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700106	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700106	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700107	So they are a diplomatic delegation... From Liyue Harbor or Inazuma City?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700107	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700107	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700108	Actually they're from <color=#00E1FFFF>Prekrasnaya</color>. They are known by an interesting name: the <color=#00E1FFFF>Fatuus</color>. You've heard of them, right?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700108	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700108	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700109	Oh, them. They are super famous.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700109	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700109	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700110	Wait, infamous is the word.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700110	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700110	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700111	You can sure say that again.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700111	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700111	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700112	However, our diplomatic relationship with them has to be maintained.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700112	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700112	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700113	The Fatuus proposed a "friendly" collaboration with us regarding the Stormterror assault.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700113	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700113	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700114	"Leave the defense of Mondstadt to us if the Stormterror threat cannot be eradicated promptly."
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700114	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700114	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700115	Their words.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700115	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700115	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700116	How rude!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700116	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700116	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700117	Prekrasnaya... It sounds...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700117	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700117	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700118	It's not what you think.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700118	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700118	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700119	Mondstadt and Prekrasnaya are both a part of the Seven Kingdoms.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700119	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700119	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700120	We're equal nations that differ only in our forms of government. Hence, a different name.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700120	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700120	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700121	What nation does Mondstadt belong to?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700121	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700121	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700122	Mondstadt is an independent city. It doesn't belong to any nation.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700122	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700122	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700123	Mondstadt and Prekrasnaya are equal as we are both a part of the Seven Kingdoms.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700123	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700123	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700124	Prekrasnaya just shares a different form of government from us, that's all.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700124	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700124	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700125	Therefore, Mondstadt will not accept any unequal treatments.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700125	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700125	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700126	That said, the Fatuus are known to be the most powerful organization on this land...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700126	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700126	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700127	By the way, the whole Gothic Hotel has been reserved for the delegation alone.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700127	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700127	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700128	If you have time, be sure to check out their overbearing attitude.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700128	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700128	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700129	Let's go, {NICKNAME}. I wanna see what kinda vile people they are.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700129	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700129	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700130	I don't mean right away.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700130	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700130	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700131	Ugh... Okay... We talk about Stormterror then.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700131	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700131	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700132	The Fatuus want to kill it, right? How about the Favonius?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700132	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700132	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700133	How will the Knights of Favonius deal with Stormterror?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700133	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700133	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700134	I don't think killing the dragon is the right course of action.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700134	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700134	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700135	It's hostile, sure, but it hasn't killed anyone. Aside from that, it's growing fast in terms of size and strength.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700135	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700135	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700136	Valid points to be investigated. We'll formulate our plans when we have more info.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700136	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700136	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700137	Paimon... and you, traveler. I believe you've seen Stormterror...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700137	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700137	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700138	I mean, up close and personal.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700138	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700138	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700139	That was our first encounter...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700139	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700139	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700140	Not THAT close, mind you.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700140	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700140	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700141	Sorry, Acting Grandmaster! I forgot to mention it in my report, but they did not conceal this incident from me.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700141	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700141	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700142	It was said, Stormterror landed on a boulder in the forest... and was not emotionally stable.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700142	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700142	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700143	Emotionally unstable? How so?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700143	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700143	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700144	It was... scared away, it seems to me. It left this thing on the site.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700144	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700144	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700145	Is this... a gem of some kind?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700145	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700145	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700146	No. It's a crystal embedded with some kind of power. Lisa, are you able to analyze it?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700146	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700146	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700147	Let me see...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700147	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700147	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700148	I can see impurities in the crystal, but I'll need to study it some more...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700148	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700148	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700149	No useful info for the moment. Give me some time, I'll look into the forbidden books section.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700149	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700149	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700150	Right. I'll leave the research to you then, Lisa.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700150	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700150	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700151	I'll notify you if I find anything.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700151	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700151	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700152	However, don't get your hopes up. They are ancient texts... And also--Ouch!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700152	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700152	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700153	Gosh, that hurt!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700153	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700153	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700154	The impurities in the crystal... It hurts when I get close to it...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700154	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700154	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700155	I see... A repelling reaction with <color=#00E1FFFF>a Vision</color>.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700155	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700155	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700156	The impure powers and our elemental energy repel each other.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700156	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700156	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700157	Strange, though. {NICKNAME} can utilize the elements as well, but not exhibiting any signs of repellence.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700157	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700157	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700158	...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700158	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700158	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700159	Anyway, the crystal should better be kept by my cutie. It's just unnecessary trouble in our hands.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700159	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700159	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700160	Cutie?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700160	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700160	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700161	Okay. Will do.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700161	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700161	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700162	...How incredible.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700162	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700162	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700163	Do you know anything about everything that's special about you?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700163	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700163	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700164	...*shakes head*
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700164	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700164	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700165	I'd think so too. Well, then, {NICKNAME}... The Favonius has another favor to ask you...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700165	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700165	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700166	Please accept the title of the <color=#00E1FFFF>Honorable Knight</color> of Favonius... A thank-you from the Acting Grandmaster.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700166	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700166	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700167	We ask only for your continued assistance in investigating the mysteries.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700167	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700167	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700168	The feral Stormterror and strange crystals... I know the peace of Mondstadt hangs upon the answers.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700168	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700168	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700169	Now then, may the Wind open your eyes to the truth.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700169	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700169	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3700170	We'll meet back here if you find anything.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3700170	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3700170	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3710101	There's something you didn't tell them.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3710101	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3710101	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3710102	The dragon and the tear weren't the only things we saw.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3710102	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3710102	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3710103	I'd like to investigate it on my own first.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3710103	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3710103	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3710104	I think he's not a bad guy.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3710104	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3710104	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3710105	So you do remember him, that green guy.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3710105	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3710105	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3710106	He seems to be able to talk to the dragon. The dragon listens to him as well.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3710106	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3710106	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3710107	If that green guy is still around, we'll definitely be able to get some info out of him.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3710107	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3710107	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3710108	...*nods*
DialogData_TalkTitle_3710108	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3710108	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3710109	Let's start looking into it then.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3710109	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3710109	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3710110	Actually there are reasons I thought of this.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3710110	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3710110	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3710111	First off, it's because of my 99% of genius and 1% of keen observation.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3710111	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3710111	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3710112	Second off, seeing that green little guy over there lets me realize the connection.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3710112	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3710112	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3710113	That's the Paimon I'm taking about.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3710113	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3710113	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3710114	See? See?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3710114	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3710114	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3710115	But... I feel like that guy... looks like...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3710115	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3710115	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3710116	They're the same person——?!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3710116	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3710116	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3710117	Well... Looks like him...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3710117	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3710117	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3710118	What——?!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3710118	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3710118	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3710901	The green guy ran away.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3710901	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3710901	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3710902	Use <color=#00E1FFFF>Element Sight</color> to look for clues.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3710902	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3710902	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3711501	Footprints end by the wall... Did he <color=#00E1FFFF>climb up</color> from here?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3711501	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3711501	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3711502	Let's go after him from here!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3711502	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3711502	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720101	Ah, you guys are...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720101	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720101	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720102	Oh, right! you're the ones that scared <color=#00E1FFFF>Dvalin</color> away.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720102	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720102	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720103	Dvalin?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720103	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720103	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720104	Yes, Dvalin. That's the name of the highly popular Stormterror.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720104	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720104	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720105	Never heard of it... Did you name it yourself?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720105	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720105	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720106	Who knows?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720106	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720106	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720107	Hey, {NICKNAME}, I think this guy is a bit strange...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720107	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720107	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720108	Excuse me.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720108	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720108	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720109	Good day, outsider. We've met before.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720109	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720109	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720110	I'm sorry, you are?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720110	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720110	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720111	I'm Venti the bard.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720111	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720111	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720112	Three times winner of the "Most Popular Bard of Mondstadt," to be precise.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720112	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720112	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720113	So, what do you need from us?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720113	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720113	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720114	Since you've recognized us, I believe there's no need to explain further.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720114	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720114	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720115	It's about Stormterror, of course.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720115	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720115	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720116	Storm...?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720116	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720116	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720117	Hey! Don't pretend that you don't know!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720117	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720117	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720118	{NICKNAME}, can you show that to him?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720118	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720118	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720119	Oh! Isn't this——
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720119	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720119	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720120	What? The crystal has been purified? When?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720120	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720120	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720121	Not sure how this happened.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720121	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720121	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720122	The last time I checked, it was full of impurities.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720122	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720122	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720123	It's Dvalin...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720123	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720123	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720124	This is a tear of anguish that Stormterror shed.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720124	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720124	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720125	Tear...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720125	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720125	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720201	It was once a caring child. Look how sad and angry it has become now...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720201	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720201	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720202	...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720202	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720202	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720203	I also have a Teardrop Crystal here.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720203	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720203	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720204	Can you purify it?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720204	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720204	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720205	...*nods*
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720205	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720205	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720501	Ehhhh!?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720501	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720501	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720502	I knew you were special.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720502	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720502	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720503	Even if Dvalin was not taken down, his life will wither rapidly...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720503	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720503	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720504	He'll burn himself out in the flames of anger. I want to save him.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720504	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720504	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720505	I empathize with Dvalin's situation.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720505	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720505	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720506	Thank you for that, and for purifying the Teardrop Crystal.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720506	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720506	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720507	Now is my turn.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720507	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720507	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720508	Is there anything I can help?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720508	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720508	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720509	Purifying the Teardrop Crystal helped a lot already. I really appreciate it.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720509	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720509	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720510	But now, I've devised my own plan.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720510	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720510	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720511	As a knight, I suggest you turn yourself in along with the dragon.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720511	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720511	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720512	Wait, is that really necessary?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720512	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720512	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720513	Forget about turning in for now... I have another plan.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720513	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720513	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720514	I'll go fetch the <color=#00E1FFFF>Holy Lyre</color>.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720514	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720514	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720515	Holy Lyre der Himmel?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720515	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720515	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720516	One of the most treasured items in Mondstadt, it's the lyre that Barbatos used to play.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720516	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720516	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720517	With that, perhaps I can help Dvalin to get its gentle nature back.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720517	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720517	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720518	The black blood flowing into its heart has been torturing it for years.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720518	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720518	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720519	That's why it was corrupted by the lies of an <color=#00E1FFFF>Abyss Mage</color> this time.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720519	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720519	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720520	Abyss Mage? Never heard of this name.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720520	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720520	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720521	They are from the <color=#00E1FFFF>Abyss Clergy</color>, an organization comprised of non-human beings. They are an opponent of mankind.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720521	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720521	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720522	I think I've heard of it in Mondstadt...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720522	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720522	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720523	Yes, the <color=#00E1FFFF>Abyss Clergy</color>. An organization comprised of non-human beings and is an opponent of mankind.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720523	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720523	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720524	I don't know where they come from. All I know is that they hold deep hatred towards human's world.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720524	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720524	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720525	The mages in the clergy specialize in mesmerism, corruption, and manipulation.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720525	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720525	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720526	Many Hilichurls in the fields work for them.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720526	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720526	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720527	So, the Holy Lyre...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720527	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720527	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720528	Playing songs using Anemo Archon's treasure can remove the corruption and curse.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720528	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720528	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720529	Will that really stop Stormterror from causing more damage?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720529	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720529	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720530	Of course. I'm the best bard in the world.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720530	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720530	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720531	There's not a single song I do not know, no matter it's in the past, present, or future.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720531	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720531	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720532	Look me in the eyes. Don't you find me trustworthy?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720532	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720532	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720533	...Fishy.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720533	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720533	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720534	Guess it won't hurt if I trust him...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720534	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720534	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720535	The color of your eyes resembles the sky of my hometown.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720535	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720535	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720536	Hahaha, that one doesn't work on a bard.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720536	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720536	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720537	So, how can we obtain the Holy Lyre?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720537	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720537	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720538	It's said that it's enshrined in the <color=#00E1FFFF>Cathedral</color> somewhere safe.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720538	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720538	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3720539	I'll go take a look around. You can come if you want.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3720539	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3720539	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730901	The church has been a mess recently, and the Bishop is not here... *sigh*
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730901	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730901	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730902	About Stormterror, there must be something we are still not aware of...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730902	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730902	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730903	About Stormterror.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730903	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730903	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730904	The change of its size and power really is suspicious.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730904	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730904	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730905	But for the Knights of Favonius, our priority is to settle down the aftermath of this attack.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730905	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730905	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730906	The Grandmaster entrusted the Knights of Favonius to me. I can't let him or the people of Mondstat down.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730906	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730906	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730907	I must find out the truth...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730907	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730907	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730908	About the Fatuus.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730908	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730908	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730909	Those people in strange uniforms... are the Fatuus.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730909	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730909	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730910	They're here as delegates from Prekrasnaya.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730910	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730910	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730911	Stay away from them. Having contact with them is dangerous, even for unrelated travelers.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730911	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730911	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730912	Goodbye.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730912	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730912	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730913	May the Wind guide you.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730913	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730913	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730915	Wow, congratulations, new guy. The Honorable Knight of Favonius... As your superior, you have my approval.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730915	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730915	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730916	Sir.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730916	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730916	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730917	This is the first time I'm being called a "Sir"!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730917	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730917	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730918	Is this what it feels like? I have to say, it feels Great!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730918	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730918	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730919	Sorry that I thought you were suspicious. Now that was embarrassing.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730919	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730919	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730920	Ask about gliders.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730920	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730920	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730921	As a novice within the Knights of Favonius, your understanding of the wind is absolutely crucial.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730921	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730921	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730922	Leave the advanced wind glider training to me!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730922	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730922	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730923	Goodbye.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730923	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730923	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730924	Let's all do our best to defeat Stormterror!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730924	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730924	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730926	It's getting harder to talk to acquaintances. 
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730926	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730926	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730927	About the library.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730927	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730927	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730928	You can come here whenever you need to look something up.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730928	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730928	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730929	Using the library is free.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730929	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730929	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730930	Just don't forget to return books on time, or it'll be very 
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730930	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730930	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730931	About monsters.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730931	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730931	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730932	About the monsters in the fields? We've got many resources here.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730932	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730932	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730933	Making good use of the elemental reaction is the key to wining any battle.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730933	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730933	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730934	By the way, are you interested in getting a part-time job here?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730934	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730934	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730935	We need a handyman... I mean, someone to support us.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730935	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730935	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730936	Goodbye.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730936	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730936	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730937	You're leaving? Drop by some times.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730937	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730937	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730939	The Acting Grandmaster needs to consider many things. For me, direct engagement is not a bad option...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730939	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730939	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730940	Why is Jean the Acting Grandmaster?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730940	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730940	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730941	The Grandmaster is on a long-term leave, so the responsibility of running the Knights now falls on the Master, Jean.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730941	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730941	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730942	And this is how Jean received the title Acting Grandmaster.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730942	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730942	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730943	When the Grandmaster left, he also took four-fifths of our knights with him, so what is left for the Acting Grandmaster is five times the responsibility and stress.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730943	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730943	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730944	Come to think of it, it must have been difficult for Jean.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730944	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730944	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730945	About hobby.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730945	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730945	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730946	Wine tasting, I guess.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730946	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730946	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730947	Wine from Mondstadt is the gift from the Anemo Archon. It'll be a waste if you don't know how to appreciate it.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730947	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730947	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730948	Oh, you're underage. Then try Mondstadt's apple vinegar.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730948	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730948	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730949	A glass of apple vinegar with a drop of berry syrup. Lots of travelers come to Mondstadt for that.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730949	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730949	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730950	Goodbye.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730950	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730950	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3730951	Goodbye. May the Wind guide you.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3730951	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3730951	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740201	Let me handle it——
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740201	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740201	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740202	Hi there.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740202	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740202	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740203	May Anemo Archon bless you, young bard. How can I help you?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740203	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740203	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740204	Actually, I know a secret that can save Mondstadt.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740204	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740204	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740205	Oh, what a blessing from the Anemo Archon.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740205	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740205	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740206	But you should report that to the Knights of Favonius. Why have you come to me?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740206	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740206	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740207	Hahaha, I came to you for a reason, of course.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740207	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740207	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740208	Let's say... the Holy Lyre der Himmel. With that I'll be able to let the Stormterror——
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740208	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740208	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740209	Please see yourself out.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740209	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740209	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740210	What?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740210	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740210	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740211	It's a viscous dragon indeed, but once the Acting Grandmaster makes up her mind, nothing can stand in the Knights' way.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740211	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740211	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740212	But then the Stormterror will be killed. We can't do that.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740212	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740212	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740213	Foolish beast that betrayed the East. Even the Anemo Archon will not forgive it!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740213	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740213	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740214	Ugh...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740214	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740214	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740215	Well... Please!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740215	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740215	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740216	I'm afraid no, little bard.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740216	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740216	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740217	(Strange... Somehow I fell so bad rejecting this sweet little boy...)
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740217	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740217	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740218	Hm... Guess there's only one way left.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740218	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740218	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740219	I cannot hide anymore!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740219	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740219	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740220	My disciples, rejoice! Behold, the <color=#00E1FFFF>Anemo Archon Barbatos</color> has descended——
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740220	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740220	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740221	Shocked, aren't you? Are you about to cry? How does it feel to finally meet the Archon you've been serving?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740221	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740221	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740222	If there's nothing else, I'll go back to handle the Cathedral's paperwork.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740222	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740222	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740223	Wait——
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740223	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740223	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740301	Eh? She didn't even bat an eyelid.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740301	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740301	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740302	But in fact, I've got what I wanted to know.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740302	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740302	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740303	At least she didn't deny that the Cathedral is enshrining the Holy Lyre.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740303	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740303	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740304	Now, {NICKNAME}, since you're the hotshot of the Knights of Favonius...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740304	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740304	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740305	Maybe you can give it a shot.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740305	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740305	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740306	Don't be shy. Go.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740306	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740306	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740401	Anemo Archon bless you.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740401	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740401	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740402	Hello.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740402	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740402	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740403	Ah, you are the newcomer of the Knights of Favonius, aren't you?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740403	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740403	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740404	I am the Honorable Knight of the Favonius, {NICKNAME}.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740404	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740404	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740405	I know you. You and Amber saved Mondstadt that day.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740405	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740405	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740406	So what brings you here? Tasks from the Acting Grandmaster?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740406	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740406	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740411	Actually...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740411	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740411	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740424	Actually... the Knights of Favonius would like to borrow the Holy Lyre...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740424	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740424	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740412	Is that true?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740412	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740412	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740413	Not that I don't trust you. It's just that a suspicious bard came to borrow the Holy Lyre as well.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740413	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740413	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740414	He's full of nonsense and even called himself Barbatos. He must be up to something.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740414	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740414	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740415	Borrowing the Holy Lyre requires going through some regulations. Currently it's only used in Ludi Harpastum.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740415	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740415	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740416	Signed documents from the Grandmaster, Bishop, and representatives of the people are all required.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740416	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740416	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740417	So, may I see the document from the Knights of Favonius?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740417	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740417	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740418	The Grandmaster didn't mention it...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740418	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740418	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740419	I'm sorry, I forgot to bring it here.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740419	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740419	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740420	Paimon ate it on our way here.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740420	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740420	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740421	Hey!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740421	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740421	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740422	Anyway, a signed document is required.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740422	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740422	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3740423	Now, if you'll excuse me. I've been really busy lately.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3740423	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3740423	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3750101	It didn't work... I knew it. 
DialogData_TalkTitle_3750101	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3750101	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3750102	You knew it?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3750102	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3750102	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3750103	I just wanted to know how influential {NICKNAME}, as the hotshot of the Knights of the Favonius, is.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3750103	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3750103	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3750104	You see, the hero took the precious sword in the village——
DialogData_TalkTitle_3750104	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3750104	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3750105	Isn't that a story worthy of song?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3750105	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3750105	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3750106	Humph, your analogy sounds rude, bard.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3750106	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3750106	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3750107	No, that's not it. It's a disappointment toward Mondstadt's stinginess.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3750107	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3750107	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3750108	Well then. Looks like getting it legally is not possible. We'll need to find a way around.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3750108	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3750108	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3750109	All kinds of thoughts are appreciated. Any suggestions?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3750109	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3750109	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3750110	...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3750110	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3750110	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3750111	Speak up. That's what free will is for.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3750111	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3750111	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3750112	I don't want to steal anything!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3750112	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3750112	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3750113	Hahaha, look at you. Sidetracked from the start.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3750113	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3750113	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3750114	But seriously, you're more suitable for this job.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3750114	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3750114	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3750115	I don't have any talent other than singing, after all.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3750115	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3750115	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3750116	Besides, I don't have anyone to go to if I was mischarged.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3750116	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3750116	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3750117	How can you be mischarged if you got caught stealing things.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3750117	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3750117	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3750118	But things are different for {NICKNAME}. You are the superstar of the Knights of Favonius, and have made contributions to Mondstadt.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3750118	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3750118	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3750119	Even if you fail, you should be able to get away easily.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3750119	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3750119	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3750120	Already thinking about getting away?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3750120	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3750120	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3750121	Um... well...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3750121	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3750121	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3750122	Although Mondstadt and Stormterror are both in need of help, stealing is still...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3750122	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3750122	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3750123	I get it, I totally get it.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3750123	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3750123	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3750124	It's not something a knight should do. But we're running out of time.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3750124	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3750124	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3750125	{NICKNAME}... what do you say?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3750125	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3750125	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3750126	I'll try.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3750126	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3750126	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3750127	You might want to prepare the retreat route first.

DialogData_TalkTitle_3750501	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3750501	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3750502	Freeze!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3750502	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3750502	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3750503	What are you doing here?!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3750503

DialogData_TalkContent_3750504	Oh no! Run!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3750504

DialogData_TalkTitle_3750505	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3750505	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3750506	Oh nooooo——
DialogData_TalkTitle_3750506	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3750506	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3750507	We're busted! Run!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3750507	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3750507	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3750508	What?! Follow me!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3750508	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3750508	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3750509	Follow me!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3750509	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3750509	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3750510	How did you screw your only job!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3750510	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3750510	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760401	Mr Diluc, this is this week's account.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760401	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760401	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760402	The disaster did impact our business greatly.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760402	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760402	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760403	Let's hope all ends soon.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760403	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760403	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760404	Hi, we'd like to sit at a less obvious spot.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760404	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760404	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760405	Second floor has fewer customers.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760405	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760405	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760406	But aren't you a bard? Why not sit at the center?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760406	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760406	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760407	Hahaha, leave the paid performance for next time. See you!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760407	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760407	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760408	Keep an eye on them. That bard is fishy. I'll go ask around.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760408	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760408	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760409	Um... Ask who?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760409	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760409	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760410	The "security" of Mondstadt.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760410	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760410	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760411	Not going upstairs yet? You guys seemed to be in a hurry.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760411	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760411	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760601	Ah, Mr Diluc. Have you seen those two thieves? 
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760601	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760601	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760602	What happened? Why are there so many people?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760602	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760602	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760603	Haven't you heard, Mr Diluc? Two theives were trying to steal the Holy Lyre!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760603	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760603	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760604	Oh? Now that's weird.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760604	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760604	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760605	I know right? The Holy Lyre is a treasure that was played by the Anemo Archon itself. Such a precious cultural property——
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760605	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760605	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760606	Why would someone want to steal that dingy lyre. Might as well come steal my vault.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760606	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760606	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760607	...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760607	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760607	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760608	Sorry, that was off topic. Those two are heading that way.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760608	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760608	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760609	OK. Thank you, Mr Diluc.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760609	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760609	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760701	I'd like to have...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760701	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760701	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760702	Put that bottle you stole from the back of the counter down.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760702	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760702	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760703	...something cold.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760703	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760703	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760704	Now, you two should answer my questions.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760704	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760704	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760705	Let me finish first. I'll pay, well, with my performance.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760705	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760705	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760706	It's not about money. You seem too young to be drinking.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760706	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760706	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760707	No need to worry. When I was drinking, you were still——
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760707	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760707	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760708	How about answering my question first?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760708	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760708	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760709	You want to ask about him, right?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760709	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760709	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760710	Who is he?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760710	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760710	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760711	He is Mr <color=#00E1FFFF>Diluc</color>, the boss of... the owner of the tavern.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760711	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760711	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760712	He's very famous. By the way, his dandelion wine is one of my favorite.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760712	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760712	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760713	Though most of the time I can only afford a bottle or two...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760713	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760713	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760714	I just heard about the thieves from the guards.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760714	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760714	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760715	For the record, I like your guts for trying to steal the Holy Lyre der Himmel.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760715	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760715	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760716	You're fools, but we don't often see 
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760716	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760716	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760717	We were not stealing. It's a misunderstanding.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760717	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760717	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760718	This is the hotshot of the Knights of Favonius. Why would he want to steal Mondstadt's sacred treasure?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760718	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760718	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760719	Hotshot...? Oh, so it's you.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760719	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760719	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760720	So, you and that bard are close friends?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760720	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760720	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760721	We're not close, actually.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760721	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760721	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760722	I've only heard him play once
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760722	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760722	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760723	Well... As an traveler, you offered your help to Mondstadt at the most desperate time.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760723	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760723	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760724	You're too good to join the Knights of Favonius.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760724	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760724	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760725	The Knights of Favonius are way too cautious on the Stormterror issue. 
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760725	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760725	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760726	In terms of diplomacy, they are also weak and conservative when facing the <color=#00E1FFFF>Fatuus</color>.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760726	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760726	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760727	Forget it. I don't feel like talking about it.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760727	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760727	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760728	Looks like you don't like the Knights of Favonius, Mr Diluc.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760728	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760728	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760729	I'm just taking a different path than theirs.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760729	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760729	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760730	I have my own hopes for this city.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760730	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760730	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760731	Now, answer me. Why did you steal the Holy Lyre?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760731	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760731	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760732	Are you sure you want to know? You might be involved in the troubles related to the Knights of Favonius.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760732	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760732	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760733	...That's fine. I am a trouble myself in the eyes of the Knights of Favonius.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760733	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760733	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760734	If I tell you the story with my performance, will you believe me?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760734	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760734	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760735	It depends. I'll make my own judgment.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760735	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760735	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760736	Then——will I get paid?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760736	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760736	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760737	The pay ranges from 5 Mora to the Holy Lyre. It all depends on your story.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760737	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760737	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760738	Very well. I'll bring you one more show——
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760738	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760738	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760739	What did I just see...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760739	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760739	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760740	The poem picks up an ancient memory, notes and words turns the vision into reality.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760740	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760740	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760741	It was all real history, written by the Anemo Archon itself.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760741	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760741	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760742	I see...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760742	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760742	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760743	The truth you performed is way more complicated than I thought.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760743	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760743	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760744	This is confidential information. Why did you let me know?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760744	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760744	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760745	Why? Well, perhaps the flow of the wind is changing.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760745	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760745	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760746	——What say you, Lord Diluc?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760746	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760746	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760747	Interesting.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760747	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760747	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760748	I can try to hook you up.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760748	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760748	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760749	I'll bring someone that can help you <color=#00E1FFFF>tomorrow night</color>.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760749	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760749	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760750	Outsider, it seems that you are not suspected because you're one of the Knights.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760750	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760750	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760751	Blonde is the only description on the wanted poster. You should be safe.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760751	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760751	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760752	As for the bard, it's better that you stay at the tavern.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760752	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760752	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760753	No problem! I like it.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760753	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760753	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760754	...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760754	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760754	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3760755	OK. Let's meet here <color=#00E1FFFF>tomorrow night</color> after the tavern closes.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3760755	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3760755	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770201	You're here.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770201	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770201	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770202	Wait, aren't you... {NICKNAME}?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770202	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770202	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770203	...Jean?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770203	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770203	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770204	Why is the Grandmaster here?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770204	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770204	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770205	First of all, I'm letting you know that I contacted more than one person.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770205	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770205	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770206	Secondly, she came here as "Jean" herself, not as the Grandmaster.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770206	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770206	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770207	This is someone you would never see, even if you're an honorable knight.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770207	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770207	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770208	What a surprise.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770208	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770208	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770209	I did hear about the Holy Lyre, but I didn't know it was you.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770209	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770209	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770210	So, Diluc told me that the sound of the Holy Lyre could purify Stormterror's mind and bring it back to normal... Is that true?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770210	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770210	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770211	That's right! {NICKNAME} is putting himself in the front line for the whole Stormterror thing.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770211	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770211	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770212	Now that's the hotshot of the Knights of Favonius {MATEAVATAR#SEXPRO[INFO_MALE_PRONOUN_BOY|INFO_FEMALE_PRONOUN_GIRL]} I'm talking about.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770212	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770212	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770213	I feel like we're breaking the law though...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770213	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770213	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770214	This explanation is too absurd to believe.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770214	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770214	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770215	BThat's fine. We can ask the bard to play the song again to persuade...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770215	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770215	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770216	I believe you.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770216	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770216	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770217	to persuade our stubborn commander... Wait, what?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770217	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770217	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770218	As one of the guardians of the Four Winds, I can't think of any reason for Dvalin's betrayal.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770218	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770218	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770219	However, if it was affected by the poisonous blood in the battle of Mondstadt many years ago...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770219	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770219	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770220	and corrupted by the Abyss Mages after it wakes up, then we can't really blame it.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770220	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770220	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770221	——But I cannot say those words as the Acting Grandmaster.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770221	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770221	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770222	Due to the diplomatic pressure from the Fatuus, it's hard for the Knights of Favonius to publicly offer the olive branch to Stormterror.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770222	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770222	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770223	That will be deemed as connivance, that's why I can only do this in private.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770223	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770223	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770224	Humph.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770224	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770224	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770225	That's one of the reasons I don't like the Knights of Favonius.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770225	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770225	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770226	What surprises me is that you would believe an outsider that easily...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770226	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770226	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770227	Well, even you, my cautious and meticulous <color=#00E1FFFF>superior</color>, believed {MATEAVATAR#SEXPRO[INFO_MALE_PRONOUN_HE|INFO_FEMALE_PRONOUN_SHE]}, didn't you, Sir?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770227	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770227	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770228	I already told you not to call me Sir... Never mind. We don't often get to work together after all.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770228	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770228	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770229	Sir?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770229	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770229	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770230	(Pretends not to hear anything)
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770230	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770230	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770231	...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770231	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770231	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770232	...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770232	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770232	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770233	I guess it's a matter that shouldn't be pushed further...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770233	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770233	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770234	Well... So far, we've managed to gather two signatures: on the behalf of the Knights and the people.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770234	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770234	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770235	(Smooth! She's really talented when it comes to changing the subject...)
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770235	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770235	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770236	Is Lord Diluc acting as the people's representative?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770236	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770236	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770237	Of course, I am. Any issue with it?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770237	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770237	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770238	Grandmaster, Bishop, People's representative... There's only one signature missing among those three.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770238	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770238	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770239	That's too bad. The Bishop is away from Mondstadt as we speak, but there might be another way to solve this issue.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770239	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770239	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770240	Follow Jean, she'll take you to someone.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770240	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770240	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770241	Get moving, quick.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770241	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770241	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770401	Get moving, quick.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770401	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770401	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770402	Acting Grandmaster Jean... I'm sure she has many stories to tell.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770402	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770402	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770301	It's still early. The tavern closes <color=#00E1FFFF>after midnight</color> and that person will show up when the time comes.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770301	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770301	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770302	The tavern closes <color=#00E1FFFF>after midnight</color>, right? Then, I'll have drinks... Don't worry, I won't get drunk.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770302	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770302	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770303	Don't forget about the meeting of <color=#00E1FFFF>tomorrow night</color>.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770303	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770303	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3770304	Okay, got it. <color=#00E1FFFF>Tomorrow night</color>, right? Don't worry, I'll show up...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3770304	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3770304	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780101	Are you ready?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780101	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780101	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780102	Let's go!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780102	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780102	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780103	Wait a second.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780103	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780103	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780201	Who are we meeting?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780201	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780201	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780202	She's the church Deaconess. Someone... reliable.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780202	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780202	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780203	A cleric? ...I'm scared of them.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780203	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780203	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780204	Why?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780204	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780204	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780205	Because we used to steal... err... borrow... No! Nothing!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780205	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780205	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780206	...If you say so.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780206	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780206	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780207	We've mentioned it before, but we need the simultaneous approval of the three parties to borrow the Holy Lyre.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780207	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780207	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780208	Diluc and I can act as the representatives for the Knights and the People, but we'll need the help of someone to get the church's approval.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780208	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780208	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780209	This person must be awesome then.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780209	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780209	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780210	She's hard-working, but I guess you can call her awesome.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780210	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780210	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780220	We're short of time, so let's do our best secure the Holy Lyre together.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780220	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780220	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780301	Ah, it's Acting Grandmaster Jean... with two strangers.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780301	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780301	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780302	Thank you for meeting us, Barbara.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780302	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780302	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780303	!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780303	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780303	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780304	Jean... I mean Acting Grandmaster Jean. Lately, you've been often up till late at night. Is everything alright?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780304	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780304	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780305	I'm okay. Let's not beat around the bush...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780305	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780305	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780306	This is {NICKNAME}, an honorable Knight of Favonius and Paimon, a traveler. 
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780306	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780306	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780307	Nice to meet you!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780307	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780307	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780308	We came to borrow the Holy Lyre to save Mondstadt from its demise.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780308	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780308	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780309	The Holy Lyre? I keep hearing about it lately...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780309	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780309	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780310	Oh right, someone attempted to steal it.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780310	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780310	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780311	Ahahaha...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780311	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780311	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780312	Please listen, Barbara. Stormterror...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780312	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780312	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780313	I've told you everything, I guess.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780313	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780313	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780314	We've collected two out the three signatures required to borrow the Holy Lyre. The only one missing is the church's.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780314	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780314	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780315	You need the Bishop to sign your document, isn't it?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780315	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780315	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780316	Yes, but he's currently away from Mondstadt, just like our <color=#00E1FFFF>Grandmaster</color>.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780316	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780316	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780317	The Knights of Favonius have you as the Acting Grandmaster, but there's no such person for the church.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780317	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780317	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780318	I'm aware of it. That's why Diluc asked you to meet us, so you could help us figure it out...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780318	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780318	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780319	I'm sorry, I don't think I can...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780319	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780319	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780320	I understand that you don't want to break the rules and neither do I, but...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780320	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780320	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780321	I wouldn't ask you if there was another way...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780321	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780321	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780322	I see. That was Diluc's job though? Why didn't he take full responsibility till the end?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780322	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780322	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780323	Woah! Is it what it looks like when two overly serious people meet?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780323	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780323	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780324	The atmosphere became stiff...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780324	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780324	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780325	You two look like sisters.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780325	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780325	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780326	Ah...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780326	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780326	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780327	...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780327	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780327	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780328	I don't think so. They are speaking to each other properly even at off hours; sisters aren't like that.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780328	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780328	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780329	Why not let Mr. Diluc take the blame for the rule-breaking?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780329	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780329	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780330	No, it'd be embarrassing for him.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780330	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780330	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780331	Err...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780331	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780331	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780332	What is it, Barbara?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780332	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780332	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780333	I guess I've made up my mind about this.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780333	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780333	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780334	I won't forge the Bishop's signature no matter what. I can't...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780334	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780334	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780335	Oh no...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780335	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780335	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780336	However, I'm convinced that you have Mondstadt's best interest at mind.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780336	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780336	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780337	I'll use my influence as the Deaconess to help you and present the document with the two other signatures to my clergy.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780337	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780337	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780338	You'll get their approval in a few days!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780338	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780338	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780339	...!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780339	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780339	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780340	You're so kind, Barbara! 
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780340	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780340	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780341	It's not "kindness," but "common sense."
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780341	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780341	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780342	Thank you.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780342	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780342	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780343	Um... Well...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780343	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780343	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780344	Ah, that's right. Let's head back together?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780344	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780344	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780345	What?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780345	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780345	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780346	What do you mean?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780346	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780346	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780347	It's too dangerous to let you go back alone.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780347	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780347	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780348	B-B-But our houses aren't in the same direction!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780348	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780348	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780349	So?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780349	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780349	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780350	What do you mean? I...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780350	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780350	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780351	Woah!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780351	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780351	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780352	Anyway, I'll just get the Holy Lyre now. Just give me the signed document after!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780352	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780352	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780401	Waiting for her return makes me anxious, but there's nothing a knight cannot do.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780401	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780401	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780402	I'll take care of the rest! Let's meet at the <color=#00E1FFFF>Fountain Plaza</color> at <color=#00E1FFFF>dawn</color>!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780402	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780402	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780403	Waiting for her return makes me anxious, but there's nothing a knight cannot do.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780403	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780403	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3780404	I'll take care of the rest! Let's meet at the <color=#00E1FFFF>Fountain Plaza</color>!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3780404	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3780404	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3950301	Ah, you're here.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3950301	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3950301	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3950302	Here is the Holy Lyre. Please handle it carefully, it's a millennial treasure.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3950302	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3950302	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3950303	Now, do what you ought to do! I'll pray for your success.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3950303	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3950303	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3950304	*holds the lyre carefully*
DialogData_TalkTitle_3950304	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3950304	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3950401	Good luck, I'll pray for your success.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3950401	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3950401	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3950402	We should hurry back to the tavern, everyone's waiting for us.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3950402	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3950402	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790201	Welcome back!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790201	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790201	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790202	Ah, this is the Holy Lyre! You guys managed to get it!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790202	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790202	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790203	The pattern of flowing wind carved on the rosewood... and the strings still feel cool to the touch too. How nostalgic...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790203	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790203	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790204	How is it, Venti? Can you summon Dvalin?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790204	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790204	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790205	Although this lyre is the real thing, I doubt that it's going to work.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790205	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790205	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790206	As you can see, the lyre has been through a thousand years of history. Its elemental power wore off.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790206	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790206	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790207	In this state, you wouldn't even able to play music with it at Diluc's tavern...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790207	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790207	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790208	A lot of bards would fight to get on the stage of that tavern. Don't be conceited!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790208	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790208	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790209	You should be concerned about other things, Mr. Diluc!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790209	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790209	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790210	Hey! Did you just borrow the Holy Lyre to play music for drunkards to hear?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790210	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790210	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790211	Aye.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790211	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790211	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790212	What do you mean?!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790212	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790212	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790213	Anyway, we won't be able to call Dvalin with it.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790213	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790213	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790214	The lyre is fine, but its strings...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790214	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790214	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790215	Time to shine, outlander!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790215	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790215	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790216	Are you talking about me?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790216	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790216	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790217	I don't know how to fix instruments.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790217	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790217	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790218	Relax! It's not broken.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790218	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790218	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790219	It's just that the intensity of its elemental power has greatly diminished.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790219	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790219	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790220	{NICKNAME}, do you still have Dvalin's teardrop crystal with you?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790220	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790220	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790221	*Nods*
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790221	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790221	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790222	Great! Try to use it on the Holy Lyre.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790222	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790222	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790301	There's no time to lose. Use it on the Holy Lyre now!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790301	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790301	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790302	Repair Holy Lyre
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790302	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790302	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790401	It worked, as expected.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790401	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790401	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790402	This youthful glow...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790402	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790402	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790403	Praising yourself, huh?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790403	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790403	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790404	...I was talking about the Holy Lyre.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790404	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790404	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790405	Thanks to {NICKNAME} for purifying the crystal, the Holy Lyre won't lose anymore power.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790405	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790405	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790406	Its powers are far from being replenished though. It'd be great if we could get more Teardrops...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790406	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790406	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790407	We'll help.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790407	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790407	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790408	How can we gather them though?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790408	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790408	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790409	Right. How do we do that?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790409	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790409	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790410	How can we make Dvalin cry? By hitting him?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790410	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790410	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790411	Dvalin must be already weeping right now...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790411	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790411	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790412	Suffering alone in a deserted place...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790412	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790412	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790413	Dvalin...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790413	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790413	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790414	My poor fellow...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790414	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790414	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790415	This isn't something that a lone knight can accomplish. Knights of Favonius, let's get moving!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790415	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790415	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790416	When you get the Teardrop Crystal, please let {NICKNAME} do the purification process.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790416	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790416	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790417	Leave it to me.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790417	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790417	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790418	Heroes supporting each other and setting out on a journey together... Fascinating!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790418	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790418	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790419	Let me come up with a song for you...

DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790419	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790420	Hey! Are you just going to run your mouth?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790420	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790420	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790421	A lyre is meant to be played by hand, my dear.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790421	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790421	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790422	Hmph. You're so cheeky... You deserve an ugly nickname.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790422	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790422	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790423	I've decided! From now on, you'll be known as the "<color=#00E1FFFF>Tone-deaf Bard</color>"!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790423	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790423	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790501	Are you really call me the "Tone-deaf Bard" forever? Poor me...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790501	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790501	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790502	Let's go!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790502	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790502	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3790503	I don't know how they came to this, but... okay, I guess.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3790503	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3790503	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3800101	Diluc, I heard that the Fatuus has proclaimed you "persona non grata."
DialogData_TalkTitle_3800101	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3800101	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3800102	Hmph, what an honor.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3800102	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3800102	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3800103	Nobody was ever proclaimed "persona grata" by the Fatuus anyway.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3800103	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3800103	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3800104	"The Fatuus"... The diplomatic delegation from Prekrasnaya? Why would they try to establish ties with Mr. Diluc?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3800104	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3800104	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3800105	The Fatuus is not only a problem that Knights have to deal with, they also represent a big threat to Mondstadt.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3800105	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3800105	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3800106	As far as threats against Mondstadt are concerned, Diluc, you...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3800106	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3800106	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3800107	That's enough, Jean.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3800107	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3800107	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3800108	You Knights are subjected to too many restrictions. You can't directly confront this so-called "diplomatic" scum.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3800108	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3800108	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3800109	Personally, I hate their guts.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3800109	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3800109	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3800110	If I were to choose between "eating an Cryo Slime alive" or "joining the Fatuus"...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3800110	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3800110	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3800111	I'd prefer to be crushed to death by a falling meteorite.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3800111	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3800111	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3800112	Your way of life is very dramatic...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3800112	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3800112	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3800113	We're done gathering! It was hard though...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3800113	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3800113	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3800114	It's too early to relax. We're still not done with Stormterror.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3800114	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3800114	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3800115	Besides, the Fatuus could also make a move...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3800115	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3800115	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3810101	As a knight, I do have confidence in my search skills.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3810101	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3810101	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3810102	Awesome!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3810102	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3810102	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3810103	The secret to success is to find things without really looking for them.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3810103	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3810103	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3810104	Don't think too much about it and don't search too hard... Because you'll realize it's just under your foot.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3810104	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3810104	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3810105	What?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3810105	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3810105	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3810106	Don't show too much concern for it. The more you'll get frantic about it, the less likely you'll find it.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3810106	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3810106	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3810107	Look out of the corner of your eyes and you might unexpectedly stumble upon what you're searching.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3810107	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3810107	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3810108	How is that even a skill?!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3810108	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3810108	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3810109	It works though. I always managed to find my missing tortoise this way back then. 
DialogData_TalkTitle_3810109	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3810109	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3810110	...Acting Grandmaster Jean, did you have a pet tortoise?!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3810110	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3810110	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3810111	What's up with you, Paimon?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3810111	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3810111	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3810112	Nothing... But this is surprising.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3810112	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3810112	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3810113	Why?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3810113	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3810113	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3810114	I can't imagine Acting Grandmaster Jean having a pet tortoise. You surely see what I mean, Mr. Diluc?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3810114	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3810114	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3810115	No, I don't.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3810115	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3810115	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3810116	I had one too when I was a kid. What's so strange about it?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3810116	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3810116	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3810117	You too?!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3810117	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3810117	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3810118	I didn't think we'd find Dvalin's Tears in a place like this.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3810118	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3810118	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3810119	As a knight, I do have confidence in my search skills.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3810119	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3810119	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3810120	Awesome!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3810120	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3810120	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3820201	This search reminds me of a feud I have with the Fatuus.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3820201	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3820201	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3820202	Six months ago, a thief stole a treasure in the East Temple of the Four Winds.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3820202	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3820202	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3820203	Woah. What was it? A cup used by Barbatos to drink water?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3820203	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3820203	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3820204	No. Although if such a thing existed, it'd be very valuable.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3820204	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3820204	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3820205	Among all the relics they managed to dig out, one particular object was very rare...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3820205	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3820205	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3820206	It was a vial which contained the Anemo Archon's breath.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3820206	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3820206	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3820207	I see, this kind of treasure...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3820207	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3820207	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3820208	Of course, a person with a fine taste in art such as myself wanted to add this relic to my collection.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3820208	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3820208	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3820209	Once the word got out, the Fatuus started to covet this treasure as well.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3820209	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3820209	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3820210	They've been making tons of counterfeit vials that you can find everywhere.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3820210	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3820210	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3820211	In response, I just bought every bottle I could find, fake or real. We're still at it now.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3820211	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3820211	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3820212	I've bought more than two thousand fake bottles to this day, and the Fatuus still has yet to find the real one.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3820212	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3820212	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3820213	Woah. You guys are insane...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3820213	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3820213	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3820214	So, it means that the real one must be out somewhere on the black market, right?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3820214	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3820214	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3820215	Then... I'll use... err... the power of friendship to find it for you!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3820215	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3820215	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3820216	Sure, you can try. I'll take it, even if it's a fake.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3820216	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3820216	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3820217	Once you're done, find me at the winery. I'll trade you 20 bottles for a glass of wine.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3820217	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3820217	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3820101	The opponents ahead are outnumbering us! <color=#00E1FFFF>Attacking</color>them would be too dangerous, maybe we can take either of <color=#00E1FFFF>the two roads on the side</color> to sneak inside.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3820101	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3820101	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3820102	We've already accomplished our objective. Should we <color=#00E1FFFF>attack them directly</color> or <color=#00E1FFFF>sneak inside</color>? It's up to you!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3820102	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3820102	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830201	Woah!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830201	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830201	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830202	Dvalin's Protection Squad! Assemble!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830202	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830202	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830203	Let's take out the crystals we've gathered.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830203	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830203	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830204	Ah.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830204	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830204	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830205	The color of these crystals looks muddy...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830205	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830205	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830206	Dvalin... You're going through so much pain...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830206	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830206	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830207	Anyway, let's start purifying these crystals first. Please, outlander.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830207	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830207	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830208	It's hard to believe such thing is possible unless you've seen it with your own eyes.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830208	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830208	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830209	Interesting. It's like filtering wine, the process is refreshing.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830209	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830209	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830210	We should have enough Teardrops now, I guess. Then...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830210	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830210	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830211	Use the crystal on the Holy Lyre like last time.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830211	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830211	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830301	{NICKNAME}, please repair the Holy Lyre quickly!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830301	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830301	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830302	Repair Holy Lyre
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830302	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830302	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830401	It worked!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830401	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830401	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830402	It seems completely different from before.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830402	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830402	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830403	The lyre's elemental power has been fully restored. We should be able to use it now.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830403	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830403	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830404	Thank you, {NICKNAME}.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830404	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830404	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830405	Now, where should we summon Stormterror?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830405	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830405	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830406	At least not inside Mondstadt, we could suffer severe losses if everything fails.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830406	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830406	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830407	Then, at the winery...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830407	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830407	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830408	If the winery were to be destroyed, it wouldn't be a great loss... But let's not do it there.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830408	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830408	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830409	...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830409	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830409	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830410	The wind that blows at sea or in high places should be able to carry a bard's words far away.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830410	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830410	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830411	It's never going to work if the air is too dry or suffocating.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830411	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830411	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830412	I see. Sea or high places, right?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830412	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830412	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830413	Then, the most suitable location to play the lyre would be...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830413	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830413	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830414	A cliff?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830414	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830414	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830415	Near the sea?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830415	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830415	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830416	In the sky? You could play the lyre as you're gliding through the air...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830416	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830416	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830417	Even Amber would never think of doing such a thing...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830417	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830417	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830418	If you go east from Starfell Lake, there are mountains at the south of the beach.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830418	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830418	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830419	...Ah! Are you talking about THAT beach.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830419	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830419	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830420	Then, if you go along these mountains, you'll arrive to a place named <color=#00E1FFFF>Starsnatch Cliff</color>.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830420	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830420	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830421	This place meets your requirements, right?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830421	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830421	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830422	Let me think... Starsnatch Cliff...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830422	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830422	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830423	...Alright, let's do it there.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830423	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830423	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830424	Very well. Then, let's meet the Starsnatch Cliff after getting ready.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830424	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830424	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830425	Please don't be late.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830425	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830425	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830426	Yes, sir!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830426	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830426	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830427	Ah, sorry. I didn't mean to...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830427	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830427	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830501	Great job, {NICKNAME}. Now, look at what I can do!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830501	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830501	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830502	About Dvalin.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830502	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830502	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830503	Dvalin used to be my friend... I still regard him as one.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830503	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830503	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830504	We used to listen the songs of the wind and sing Ode to the Dandelion together...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830504	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830504	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830505	That's why I remember him as someone gentle.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830505	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830505	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830506	Huh? Of course, you're already my friend.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830506	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830506	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830507	About wine.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830507	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830507	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830508	Mondstadt is famous for its wine. It's the city's most prized treasure, I'd say.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830508	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830508	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830509	Its dandelion wine is the best!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830509	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830509	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830510	Actually, the scent of dandelion in the wind alone is enough to get you drunk.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830510	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830510	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830511	Ah, I almost forgot that you're underage. Such a shame... 
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830511	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830511	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830512	Goodbye.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830512	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830512	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830513	I should prepare to meet my "old friend."
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830513	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830513	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830514	Although I'm talking about myself, I can't help but speak with a dramatic tone sometimes... Maybe it's an occupational disease?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830514	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830514	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830515	About the Knights.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830515	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830515	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830516	The Knights of Favonius were all very busy dealing with the aftermath of the incident. I'm a bit ashamed of myself for it...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830516	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830516	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830517	If only I was a stronger leader...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830517	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830517	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830518	Or at least good enough to boost the morale and the strength of our troops like our Grandmaster does...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830518	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830518	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830519	No, I can't mope around. We need to solve our problem first. Right?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830519	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830519	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830520	About the Holy Lyre.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830520	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830520	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830521	Barbatos's sacred relic, Mondstadt's treasure... The Holy Lyre.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830521	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830521	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830522	No wonder it has the power to remove evil...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830522	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830522	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830523	I hope it will help us save Dvalin, like Venti says.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830523	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830523	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830524	Can we consider this lyre as a blessing from Lord Barbatos?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830524	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830524	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830525	Goodbye.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830525	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830525	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830526	May the Wind guide us to save Dvalin.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830526	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830526	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830527	Although we may be able to negotiate with Stormterror, we'll most likely have to fight. Please be ready for it.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830527	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830527	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830528	About Angel's Prescence.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830528	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830528	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830529	Some wine of the Dawn Winery is sold at the tavern named Angel's Prescence. 
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830529	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830529	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830530	I replace their bartender sometimes. If you ever need to talk to me, feel free to find me there.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830530	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830530	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830531	Otherwise, you'll need to make an appointment with my servants.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830531	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830531	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830532	Why are you helping us?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830532	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830532	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830533	I mostly decided to do it on a whim. Though I must say, that bard is quite intriguing.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830533	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830533	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830534	Besides, it's bad for my business if we keep letting Stormterror do whatever he pleases.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830534	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830534	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830535	Let me be clear though. I did it for you, not for the knights.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830535	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830535	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830536	Goodbye.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830536	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830536	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3830537	Are you done? We'll meet at Starsnatch Cliff then.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3830537	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3830537	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840201	Everyone is finally here.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840201	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840201	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840202	This place is beautiful...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840202	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840202	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840203	Lovely for a fated reunion, isn't it?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840203	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840203	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840204	Well, the preparation has begun.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840204	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840204	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840205	Regardless of the outcome, things took a turn for the better.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840205	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840205	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840206	Until today, Mondstadt has been going through so much...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840206	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840206	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840207	In the end, the solution to our problem was a traveler and a song.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840207	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840207	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840208	Well, the Knights of Favonius had their share in it too.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840208	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840208	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840209	Okay Diluc, we got it... Everyone please step aside!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840209	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840209	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840210	I, the best wandering bard of the mortal world, will start playing the Holy Lyre.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840210	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840210	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840301	
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840301	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840301	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840302	Why don't you speak?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840302	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840302	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840303	Now that I returned to Mondstadt...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840303	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840303	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840304	I've come to meet you after getting the Holy Lyre.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840304	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840304	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840305	Hmph...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840305	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840305	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840306	This might work after all...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840306	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840306	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840307	Go! Tone-Deaf Bard!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840307	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840307	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840308	Do you want to know why he's silent?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840308	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840308	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840309	It's because he gave up on you.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840309	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840309	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840310	He hates you because you drank that poisoned blood to save Mondstadt.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840310	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840310	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840311	Barbatos...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840311	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840311	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840312	You're angry...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840312	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840312	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840313	Yes, you should unleash your anger!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840313	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840313	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840314	Did these people come to kill me too?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840314	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840314	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840315	This was not how it happened-
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840315	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840315	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840316	Am I not trustworthy enough to you?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840316	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840316	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840317	In that case, I'll wreck havoc in your beloved Mondstadt!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840317	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840317	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840318	Dvalin...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840318	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840318	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840322	Aaaaack!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840322	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840322	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840401	Dvalin!!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840401	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840401	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840402	Venti, please take care of yourself.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840402	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840402	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840403	Tch. All our efforts went to waste...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840403	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840403	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840404	Hihihi...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840404	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840404	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840405	<color=#00E1FFFF>Abyss Mage</color>!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840405	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840405	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840406	The culprit behind everything was this guy...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840406	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840406	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840407	How's the Holy Lyre?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840407	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840407	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840408	Can we still play it? Or does it need to be repaired?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840408	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840408	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840409	Ugh...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840409	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840409	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840410	Unfortunately, I think it's beyond repair...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840410	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840410	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840411	We can't let this Abyss Mage get away!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840411	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840411	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840412	You're right. If we don't fight the source of evil, then we can't save Dvalin at all.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840412	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840412	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840413	Let's take care of the Abyss Mage later...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840413	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840413	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840414	Let's take care of the Abyss Mage later, Dvalin is far more dangerous...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840414	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840414	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840415	No! We should make him pay!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840415	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840415	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840416	If we don't fight the source of evil, then we can't save Dvalin at all.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840416	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840416	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840417	I shall summon an Outrider to track it down...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840417	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840417	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840418	No such need.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840418	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840418	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840419	?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840419	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840419	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840420	I slayed one of its kind in the <color=#00E1FFFF>ruins of temples</color> of the Four Wind Guardians not long ago.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840420	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840420	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840421	How? At what time...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840421	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840421	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840422	If you want to track those monsters down, why not seek help from my intelligence network? I've got other tools for the job as well.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840422	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840422	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840423	Diluc...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840423	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840423	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840424	Though he dislikes the Knights of Favonius, he protects Mondstadt in his own way.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840424	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840424	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840425	Ooh? Why does our little Paimon sound so doting all of a sudden?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840425	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840425	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840426	Humph.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840426	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840426	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840427	I'll let them know that even the Abyss Order, as anarchistic as they are...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840427	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840427	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840428	Shall not cross the line in Mondstadt.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840428	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840428	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840501	
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840501	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840501	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840601	Huh? What's this...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840601	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840601	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840602	After the Abyss Mage was defeated, certain energy dispersed from its body...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840602	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840602	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840603	This energy was meant to isolate us from Dvalin.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840603	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840603	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840604	...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840604	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840604	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840605	{NICKNAME}, do you happen to know 「<color=#00E1FFFF>the Ruins of the Wind Dragon</color>」?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840605	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840605	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840606	Nope.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840606	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840606	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840607	But Master Jean and Master Diluc must be aware of it.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840607	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840607	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840608	I think I've heard people speak of it in Mondstadt.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840608	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840608	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840609	I believe people from Mondstadt have all heard about it.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840609	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840609	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840610	When we tried to enter, we were...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840610	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840610	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840611	When we tried to enter, we were blocked off by barriers of storms.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840611	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840611	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840612	Correct.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840612	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840612	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840613	Now Dvalin resides in ruins that has become his nesting ground.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840613	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840613	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840614	Similar to the storms that enveloped Mondstadt, the entrance to his lair is also protected by nigh invincible barriers.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840614	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840614	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840615	But now, from the energy that dispersed from the Abyss Mage, I could read the rhythmic flow of how the magic was woven.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840615	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840615	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840616	Although I must admit, it sounds even more horrendous than the chorus of Hilichurls, but...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840616	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840616	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840617	...It should prove enough to let us eradicate the storms barriers and reach Dvalin's 「<color=#00E1FFFF>Ruins of the Wind Dragon</color>」.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840617	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840617	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840618	Which means we're going to confront Dvalin?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840618	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840618	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840619	I'm fine with that... But Jean is the person who wishes to avoid any direct confrontation.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840619	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840619	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840620	No. When there's no better choice, it's my job to alter the course of the game, and I will bear the full responsibility.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840620	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840620	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840621	If to slay him is our only resolve, I will gladly become the knight that leads the charge.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840621	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840621	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840622	Our situation is better than that.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840622	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840622	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840623	Hmm?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840623	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840623	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840624	By that, you mean...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840624	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840624	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840625	I mean the Holy Lyre is not our trump card.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840625	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840625	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840626	Our real trump card is - {NICKNAME}.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840626	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840626	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840627	{NICKNAME}?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840627	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840627	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840628	Is it because I purified the Teardrop Crystal?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840628	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840628	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840629	Correct.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840629	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840629	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840630	Is it because I'm powerful?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840630	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840630	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840631	Well... You could say that. {NICKNAME} is definitely a force to be reckoned with.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840631	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840631	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840632	But you have a much more precious forte.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840632	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840632	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840633	I understood it all when I touched the magic that dispersed from the Abyss Mage.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840633	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840633	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840634	The impurities in the Teardrops and the curse that binds Dvalin belongs to the same magnificent power.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840634	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840634	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840635	The ancient Anemo power that ran inside his body has run dry during his attacks against Mondstadt.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840635	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840635	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840636	The tides have turned from the time when {NICKNAME} first saw him.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840636	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840636	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840637	Dvalin can only remain active by fueling himself with his own curse.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840637	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840637	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840638	Which means...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840638	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840638	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840639	No way! You tone-deaf bard, don't you see how crazy this is?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840639	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840639	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840640	See those gaping jaws of Dvalin's? {NICKNAME} will be swallowed whole before {NICKNAME} can lift a finger!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840640	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840640	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840641	Friendly reminder that I'm a competent warrior.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840641	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840641	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840642	We must endeavor concertedly if we are to win this battle!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840642	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840642	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840643	...Hey.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840643	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840643	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840644	Nice plan, worth a shot.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840644	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840644	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840645	I am with you, honorary knight!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840645	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840645	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840646	I sense a battle of unprecedented scales impending...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840646	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840646	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840647	Our adversaries are... monsters from the Abyss, and a dragon in the flesh! I can hardly breathe.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840647	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840647	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840648	Us humans have our pride and courage. Draw your weapons!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840648	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840648	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840649	And so,
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840649	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840649	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840650	the epics of heroes have finally reached the chapter of the final hour.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840650	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840650	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840801	I shall see it to the end with my own eyes.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840801	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840801	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840802	The Knights of Favonius shall exert our utmost efforts for Mondstadt!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840802	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840802	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840803	Aren't you going yet?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840803	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840803	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840701	These are only scratches,but the Holy Lyre...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840701	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840701	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840702	According to the intelligence from Diluc, we should act quicker to ensure the creature has no chance of escape.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840702	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840702	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840703	<color=#00E1FFFF>Abyss Order</color>... Monsters that oppose us humans.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840703	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840703	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840704	Do not think you can run away unscathed after committing such fiendish acts!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840704	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840704	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840705	Let's start hounding!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840705	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840705	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840706	Wait a second.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840706	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840706	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840707	There it is!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840707	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840707	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3840708	An eye for an eye! Punish it with our might!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3840708	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3840708	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3880101	It's the storm barrier!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3880101	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3880101	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3880102	It's dangerous to watch...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3880102	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3880102	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3880103	It's collapsing! Leave it to me!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3880103	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3880103	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3880201	Enemy attack! People, prepare yourselves!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3880201	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3880201	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3880202	I suppose I have to clear the grounds before playing.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3880202	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3880202	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3880203	Such chores should not be the concerns of the singer himself, generally speaking...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3880203	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3880203	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3880204	...What's going on?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3880204	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3880204	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3880205	There shouldn't be any Hilichurls Camp in the vicinity of the Ruins of the Wind Dragon!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3880205	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3880205	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3880301	Phew...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3880301	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3880301	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3880302	Hilichurls are not intelligent enough to come up with a plan as complex as an ambush.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3880302	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3880302	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3880303	It is even quite challenging to have them understand what the word "scheme" means.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3880303	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3880303	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3880304	The Abyss Order must be manipulating them behind the curtains, yet they are uncertain of our arrival.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3880304	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3880304	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3880305	The Abyss Clergy is presumably spreading its forces to halt our plans.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3880305	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3880305	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3880306	Without further adieu-
DialogData_TalkTitle_3880306	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3880306	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3880307	I suppose I can play faster if my only audience is the wind.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3880307	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3880307	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3880401	It actually opened! You're not entirely useless, tone-deaf bard!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3880401	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3880401	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3880402	This marks our entrance into the actual Ruins of the Wind Dragon.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3880402	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3880402	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3880403	Watch yourselves. Let's move.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3880403	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3880403	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3890101	Looks like this is the front gate to the ruins.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3890101	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3890101	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3890102	The gate is enormous compared to us... But still, I wonder how Dvalin gets home with a body that huge?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3890102	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3890102	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3890103	He doesn't walk in, he flies in.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3890103	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3890103	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3890104	...You do have a point.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3890104	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3890104	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3890301	It's stuck.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3890301	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3890301	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3890302	It's stuck.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3890302	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3890302	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3890303	Hey, check out the roof over there, is that a giant hole up there?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3890303	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3890303	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3890304	Hmm... I suppose we could make use of that wind field.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3890304	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3890304	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3890305	Let's make a detour then. Heading up.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3890305	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3890305	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3890306	Let's make a detour then. Heading up.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3890306	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3890306	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3890401	Will there be hidden Abyss Mages in the ruins?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3890401	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3890401	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3890402	If we run into one, we will let the victorious Master Diluc do the...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3890402	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3890402	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3890403	Do not overlook foes that I have once defeated.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3890403	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3890403	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3890404	Oh... I do not intend to boast myself with those words. I was only trying to address the fact that more monstrous beings exist in that repulsive clergy.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3890404	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3890404	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3890405	Correct. That's why I tagged along.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3890405	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3890405	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3890406	This is also for your safety.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3890406	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3890406	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3890407	*Sigh* Why am I so diligent? Too diligent for a poet, in fact!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3890407	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3890407	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3890408	So speaks the person that made zero efforts in searching for the three Dragon Tears and spend all his day drinking in a tavern.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3890408	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3890408	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3890409	I don't get it, what part of you is remotely diligent!?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3890409	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3890409	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3890501	Look! There's the <color=#00E1FFFF>wind field</color>,
DialogData_TalkTitle_3890501	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3890501	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3890502	It might lead us to the top of the tower...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3890502	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3890502	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3890601	We can't advance any further. The ruins seem to be guarded by ancient <color=#00E1FFFF>seals</color>.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3890601	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3890601	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3890602	Is this Dvalin's work?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3890602	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3890602	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3890603	No, these machines and seals have nothing to do with Dvalin.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3890603	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3890603	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3890604	These ruins belonged to cities that predated the existence of the Four Wind Guardians.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3890604	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3890604	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3890605	Dvalin just happened to nest temporarily in these ruins.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3890605	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3890605	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3890606	I shall elaborate on the tale of the ancient city if fate permits.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3890606	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3890606	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3890607	These seals are not uncommon in the ruins of ancient civilization around Mondstadt.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3890607	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3890607	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3890608	According to my archaeological knowledge, the key lies in the <color=#00E1FFFF>"Light Actuators"</color> -
DialogData_TalkTitle_3890608	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3890608	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3890609	Destroy three of these devices and the halo guarding the seal to the <color=#00E1FFFF>third floor</color> should be lit, allowing us to break the grand seal.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3890609	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3890609	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3890610	Look! You can see one from here...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3890610	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3890610	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3890611	The device at the center of the circular platform should be it.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3890611	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3890611	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3890612	The rest must be scattered across the ruins while surrounding the tower. Let's go find them.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3890612	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3890612	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3890613	...Why did Dvalin choose this place that's riddled with puzzles and seals as his lair? Doesn't Dvalin get annoyed of them when trying to get home?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3890613	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3890613	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3890614	He doesn't walk in, he flies in.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3890614	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3890614	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3890615	...You do have a point.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3890615	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3890615	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3900101	Oh ! At the center of the circular platform...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3900101	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3900101	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3900102	That must be it! That must be the <color=#00E1FFFF>"Light Actuator"</color>!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3900102	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3900102	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3900103	Let's go take a look!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3900103	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3900103	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3900301	"The first ray of light initiates the ceremony. When three streams converge, everything takes their place..."
DialogData_TalkTitle_3900301	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3900301	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3900302	Words have appeared in the light! Steams... Does this imply there are thinner rays of light?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3900302	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3900302	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3900303	Ah! Look! More light is being emitted!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3900303	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3900303	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3900304	...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3900304	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3900304	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3900305	Looks like we'll have to touch the three thinner rays as well.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3900305	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3900305	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3910301	"The second ray of light initiates the ceremony. When three streams converge, everything takes their place."
DialogData_TalkTitle_3910301	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3910301	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3910302	Hmph, guess we still have to do things the old way.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3910302	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3910302	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3920301	"The third ray of light in the ceremony..."
DialogData_TalkTitle_3920301	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3920301	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3920302	I'm not gonna finish it. I don't see any difference in the instructions.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3920302	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3920302	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3900801	Oh wow! This <color=#00E1FFFF>"Light Actuating Ceremony"</color> or whatever it's called does work magic.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3900801	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3900801	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3900802	One of the three halos circling the tower suddenly begins to glow.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3900802	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3900802	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3900803	Let's start looking for the next puzzle!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3900803	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3900803	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3910801	Two of the halos have been lit!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3910801	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3910801	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3910802	Find one more of these and viola, the seal to the top of the tower will be broken!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3910802	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3910802	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3920801	It's done!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3920801	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3920801	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3920802	I suppose we should venture onward from there.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3920802	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3920802	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3900401	This is the first stream of light, have to touch another two.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3900401	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3900401	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3900601	Paimon: Great! Let's head back to the <color=#00E1FFFF>"Light Actuator"</color>.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3900601	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3900601	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3910501	Paimon: Touch one more stream of light and the <color=#00E1FFFF>Light Actuator</color> should be activated.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3910501	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3910501	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3920601	Finally, this is the last one! Phew, I could use a break.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3920601	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3920601	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930101	I'm thinking about turning these adventures into songs after we're done...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930101	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930101	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930102	It should be a wonderful story if everything moves smoothly.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930102	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930102	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930103	{NICKNAME}... How are you feeling today?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930103	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930103	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930104	I am perfectly prepared and should be of help to everyone.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930104	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930104	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930105	Master Jean is so reliable.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930105	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930105	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930106	Rest assured, I'm also in my best shape!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930106	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930106	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930107	Even Master Diluc accompanied us to the very end.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930107	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930107	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930108	Big talk for accidentally involved...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930108	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930108	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930109	...common folk?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930109	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930109	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930110	Hmph. You shared your secrets with me, and I only returned your trust on the same extent.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930110	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930110	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930111	So "trust" is what drove Master Diluc here.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930111	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930111	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930112	As for Master Jean... "Responsibility," perhaps?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930112	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930112	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930113	What about the tone-deaf bard?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930113	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930113	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930114	So "responsibility" is what drove Master Jean here.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930114	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930114	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930115	As for Master Diluc... "Trust," perhaps?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930115	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930115	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930116	What about the tone-deaf bard?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930116	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930116	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930117	What about Venti?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930117	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930117	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930118	It's "freedom."
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930118	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930118	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930119	Freedom...?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930119	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930119	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930120	Mondstadt is a romantic city without the reign of a "king."
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930120	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930120	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930121	And its denizens the freest amongst the seven major cities.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930121	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930121	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930122	I hope the same for the dragon that once protected Mondstadt.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930122	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930122	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930123	No one should have deceived him by telling him about Mondstadt's betrayal.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930123	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930123	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930124	And no one should have told him that his eternal duty was to protect the city.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930124	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930124	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930125	He had the right to choose whatever life that pleased him.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930125	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930125	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930126	Venti...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930126	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930126	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930127	{NICKNAME}, our trump card, the hope of Mondstadt, the hero to conquer dragons,
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930127	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930127	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930128	The one to whom we have entrusted the future of Mondstadt-
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930128	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930128	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930129	Whoa, hold it, what's with the sudden flattering? You're gonna ask us to do something crazy, aren't you?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930129	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930129	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930130	The success of the operation depends on you.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930130	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930130	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930131	Wow. I'm used to how flattering turns out.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930131	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930131	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930132	That's what it's like to be accompanies by us bards.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930132	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930132	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930133	You people deserve to be forever alone!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930133	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930133	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930134	Leave it to me.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930134	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930134	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930135	Knew I could count on you!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930135	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930135	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930136	Dvalin is smart. He will keep his altitude to avoid facing us all at one.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930136	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930136	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930137	First, we must destroy the filthy blood clots on his back and force him to land.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930137	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930137	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930138	Using your purification ability is the only way to do so.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930138	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930138	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930139	You're implying that we can only win by sending {NICKNAME} flying and going one-on-one against a dragon?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930139	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930139	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930140	What? You're not tagging along?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930140	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930140	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930141	Unfortunately, the answer is a big yes! You're our only hope now!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930141	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930141	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930142	But worry not, for the winds of Mondstadt that have been blowing for thousands of years are with you!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930142	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930142	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930143	For this one singular occasion, they will carry you until the deed is done.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930143	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930143	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930144	Do we get to fly to wherever we want?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930144	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930144	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930145	Turning winds that nurture life into winds that speak of adventures doesn't sound bad to me.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930145	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930145	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930146	But you can worry about it later after saving Dvalin.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930146	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930146	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930147	The fate of Dvalin rests in your hands.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930147	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930147	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930201	Turning winds that nurture life into winds that speak of adventures doesn't sound bad to me.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930201	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930201	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930202	The fate of Dvalin rests in your hands, so take good care of him, alright?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930202	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930202	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930301	Trust never comes without a reason...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930301	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930301	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930302	No more hesitation, let's get this done with.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930302	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930302	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930401	We are closing in...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930401	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930401	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3930402	We must be under the guidance of the winds.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3930402	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3930402	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960101	This place is gonna collapse!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960101	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960101	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960102	Speak to me!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960102	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960102	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960103	Summon me, command me.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960103	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960103	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960104	And thou shalt be saved——
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960104	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960104	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960105	You have finally returned, Dvalin.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960105	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960105	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960106	To the very end...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960106	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960106	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960107	You refused to speak.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960107	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960107	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960108	But you still saved us without receiving my orders.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960108	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960108	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960109	Your benevolent nature could not be twisted.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960109	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960109	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960110	I no longer summon you for I do not wish to give you more orders.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960110	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960110	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960111	You fought well in the bitter battle against the evil dragon a hundred years ago.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960111	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960111	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960112	I wish to rid you of your shackles, but I would rather it to be your own choice.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960112	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960112	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960113	You have such grace and beauty. You were born to fly peacefully.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960113	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960113	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960114	Unfortunately, it's too late for that.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960114	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960114	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960115	My mind has been cleared, but I shall soon——
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960115	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960115	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960116	What are you doing?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960116	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960116	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960117	You will disappear if you don't stop...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960117	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960117	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960118	It's fine if my body no longer remains.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960118	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960118	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960119	Dvalin...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960119	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960119	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960120	Venti!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960120	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960120	{NICKNAME}, Jean, Paimmon, Diluc
DialogData_TalkContent_3960121	Venti!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960121	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960121	{NICKNAME}, Jean, Paimmon, Diluc
DialogData_TalkContent_3960122	Venti!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960122	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960122	{NICKNAME}, Jean, Paimmon, Diluc
DialogData_TalkContent_3960123	Venti!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960123	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960123	{NICKNAME}, Jean, Paimmon, Diluc
DialogData_TalkContent_3960124	This is how the Stormterror incident has ended.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960124	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960124	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960125	I clarified our denizens' misunderstandings on behalf of the Knights of Favonius.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960125	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960125	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960126	I also announced that the incident has been settled.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960126	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960126	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960127	However, the rampage of the Wind Dragon happened so suddenly...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960127	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960127	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960128	Then, the sudden recovery of order...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960128	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960128	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960129	Many people may still find the situation suspicious.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960129	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960129	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960130	However, winds change their course.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960130	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960130	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960131	Someday, they will blow towards a brighter future...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960131	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960131	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960201	Phew...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960201	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960201	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960202	I'm not really in the position to speak compared to our Acting Grandmaster...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960202	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960202	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960203	However, I still want you to know how grateful we, Mondstadt people, are for your help!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960203	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960203	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960204	Luckily, everything turned out fine! Or else the number of the wounded would have skyrocketed.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960204	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960204	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960205	Now, the Fatuus have no choice but to keep their mouths shut.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960205	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960205	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960206	They must be annoyed that things didn't turn out as planned for them.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960206	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960206	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960207	This time, they even lost their best excuse to pressure the Knights of Favonius.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960207	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960207	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960208	They've gained nothing diplomatically except further confirm how vexatious the delegates of Prekrasnaya are.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960208	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960208	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960209	Back to the topic. Did you bring the Holy Lyre with you?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960209	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960209	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960210	The power of my warrant is not infinite. The Cardinal has been pressing me for a while...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960210	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960210	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960211	I did bring it with me... Ummm... It's just...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960211	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960211	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960212	Don't worry! I'm not here to collect rent! The church has always received special funding...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960212	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960212	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960213	(Show the broken Holy Lyre to Barbara)
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960213	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960213	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960214	Eeeeeek!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960214	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960214	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960215	Ummm...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960215	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960215	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960216	Ugh...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960216	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960216	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960217	AAAAAARGH!!! THE HOLY LYRE!!!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960217	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960217	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960218	Lord Barbatos, His Eminence, Barbara will spend the rest of her life atoning for her sins to you...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960218	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960218	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960219	...That won't be enough!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960219	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960219	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960220	Umm... Why don't we ask the carpenter... to craft a new one that looks just the same...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960220	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960220	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960221	Just think about it! How many people have ever seen a treasure that's this rare... Almost none, I bet.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960221	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960221	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960222	Oh... Oh no...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960222	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960222	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960223	*Sigh*
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960223	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960223	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960224	Just let me see the Holy Lyre.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960224	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960224	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960225	How could this——!?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960225	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960225	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960226	The Holy Lyre... But how?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960226	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960226	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960227	What happened?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960227	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960227	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960228	I don't care anymore!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960228	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960228	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960229	Let me see.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960229	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960229	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960230	This won't do!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960230	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960230	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960231	I don't know what happened, but I'm never lending the Holy Lyre that what just fixed to you ever again!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960231	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960231	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960401	Whoa, tone-deaf bard, where did you, you get such incredible powers!?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960401	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960401	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960402	Hmm?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960402	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960402	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960403	Well...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960403	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960403	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960404	Well, I AM a bard after all! Having broken so many strings by playing, it is only natural for me to master the art of repairing!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960404	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960404	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960405	What kind of justification was that?! In the legends, the Holy Lyre...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960405	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960405	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960406	Please excuse me for my abrupt question.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960406	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960406	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960407	If I understand correctly, you must be...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960407	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960407	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960409	Shhhh! Don't spill it.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960409	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960409	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960410	Just keep referring to me as Venti, the traveling bard, okay?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960410	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960410	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960411	...As you wish, Lord Venti.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960411	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960411	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960412	You truly are the Anemo Archon, Barbatos...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960412	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960412	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960413	Is that so?!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960413	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960413	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960414	Then why did you rely on us?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960414	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960414	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960415	Was that some sort of confession?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960415	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960415	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960416	Wait, if he truly is...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960416	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960416	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960417	Then why did you rely on us?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960417	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960417	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960418	Lord Barbatos! I...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960418	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960418	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960419	Lord Barbatos! Could you grant me three wishes?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960419	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960419	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960420	Hey.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960420	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960420	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960421	Ah, how to put it...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960421	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960421	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960422	I used to possess great powers that allowed me to cleave mountains and split mountains. Of course, the hardships you face are merely nothing to me.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960422	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960422	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960423	At that time, like other Archons, I could have chosen to lead the people and converge their powers and wishes.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960423	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960423	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960424	However, I felt that by taking control, Mondstadt would become less of what it is and what it should be.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960424	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960424	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960425	This is hard to explain and I'm not even supposed to explain it to you, but...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960425	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960425	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960426	But the path I've <color=#00E1FFFF>once</color> chosen is a path where I renounced most of my divine powers.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960426	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960426	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960427	...The Anemo Archon who stand before you is, without any doubt, the most vulnerable of the Seven Archons!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960427	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960427	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960428	You sure sounded gutsy when you said you were the weakest.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960428	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960428	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960429	No wonder you're the Archon of the City of Freedom...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960429	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960429	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960430	No wonder someone who's unpredictable like the winds is the Archon of the City of Freedom...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960430	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960430	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960431	Aww, you flatter me.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960431	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960431	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960432	...Then let's get out of this place, shall we?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960432	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960432	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960433	My magic used to "repair" the Holy Lyre isn't guaranteed to succeed, you know!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960433	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960433	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960434	What?!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960434	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3960434	 
DialogData_TalkContent_3960435	What?!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3960435

DialogData_TalkTitle_3860101	
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3860101	
DialogData_TalkContent_3860102	Oh, it's you. I had my eye on you for a long time.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3860102	
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3860102	
DialogData_TalkContent_3860103	It's also part of our job to find great adventurers.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3860103	
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3860103	
DialogData_TalkContent_3860104	From where I'm standing...
DialogData_TalkTitle_3860104	
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3860104	
DialogData_TalkContent_3860105	You are a worthy "prey." You may have the potential to rival those legendary adventurers.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3860105	
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3860105	
DialogData_TalkContent_3860106	However, "experience" is worth far more than "potential" to an adventurer.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3860106	
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3860106	
DialogData_TalkContent_3860107	You must accumulate "Adventure EXP" to promote your "Adventure Rank."
DialogData_TalkTitle_3860107	
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3860107	
DialogData_TalkContent_3860108	Which means, great stories make great adventurers!
DialogData_TalkTitle_3860108	
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3860108	
DialogData_TalkContent_3860109	How to acquire Adventurer EXP?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3860109	
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3860109	
DialogData_TalkContent_3860110	Well, maybe unearthing lost treasures, or explore dangerous wilds?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3860110	
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3860110	
DialogData_TalkContent_3860111	Since I'm willing to bet my chips on you, I'll give you an intel for free.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3860111	
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3860111	
DialogData_TalkContent_3860112	The word is, there's some rare treasures west to Springvale.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3860112	
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3860112	
DialogData_TalkContent_3860113	Thanks for the intel.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3860113	
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3860113	
DialogData_TalkContent_3860114	No need. Just a random act of kindness on my part.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3860114	
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3860114	
DialogData_TalkContent_3860115	Is it really okay to part with such a valuable intel?
DialogData_TalkTitle_3860115	
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3860115	
DialogData_TalkContent_3860116	It's fine. There are treasures scattered all across the land. You'll need to find them on your own in the future.
DialogData_TalkTitle_3860116	
DialogData_TalkRoleName_3860116

DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141005	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141005	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141006	It's just a title, nothing more.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141006	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141006	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141007	I only became some legendary adventurer for completing some top-tier requests by chance.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141007	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141007	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141008	The real legends... are for you to create! Hahaha...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141008

DialogData_TalkContent_4015141009	My story? What is there to tell?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141009

DialogData_TalkContent_4015141010	Let see... I slew three dragons, crushed two international pirate organizations, saved Teyvat once... Nothing major.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141010	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141010	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141011	...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141011	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141011	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141012	...Where was I? I think I'm getting a bit too tipsy...

DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141101

DialogData_TalkContent_4015141102	Who are you?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141102

DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141104	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141105	Stanley! Stanley! You must be a noob adventurer if you don't even know me!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141105	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141105	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141106	I am a living legend among adventurers! The man who waded through the Ashen Sea and Geyser Realm!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141106	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141106	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141107	I have enough stories to tell for three days straight...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141107	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141107	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141108	Sharp! That's the best out of all my legendary stories.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141108	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141108	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141109	On the other side of this land, there's a hidden barren place.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141109	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141109	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141110	A sea of ashes, with nothing but silence that will make your ears ring...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141110

DialogData_TalkContent_4015141111	...*goes on and on*
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141111	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141111	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141112	...And the monster created a vortex in the Ashen Sea, so I held tightly onto my friend's hand...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141112	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141112	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141113	...*goes on and on*
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141113	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141113	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141114	...Sadly, I was the only one who returned home to Mondstadt with tears in my eyes...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141114	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141114	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141115	Are you guys falling asleep!?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141115

DialogData_TalkContent_4015141116	Wake up! You!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141116	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141116	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141117	Wait, you're leaving? I'm not even halfway done!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141117	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141117	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141199	Back then...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141199	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141199	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141201	Stanley... Stanley... Your name shall never be forgotten...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141201	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141201	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141202	Why are you repeating your own name?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141202	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141202	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141203	What happened?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141203	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141203	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141204	Excuse me for bothering you.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141204	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141204	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141205	You heard that...? Never mind... *sighs*
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141205	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141205	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141206	Stanley... isn't really my name, but the name of the leader to the brigade I once belonged to.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141206	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141206	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141207	As for who I am... It doesn't really matter. I'm the one that supposed to be dead...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141207	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141207	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141208	So why am I the one alive... Why... Stanley... Stanley...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141208	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141208	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141209	Back at the Ashen Sea... I was just a noob, and Stanley was the rising star of an adventurer...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141209	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141209	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141210	But, before he could become a legend... He... for me...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141210	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141210	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141211	I returned alone in the end. Yes, just me... But I shall never let his stories end with him...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141211	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141211	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141212	I keep on telling his stories... His name... Because I want people to remember him and his stories...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141212	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141212	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141213	The stories of the man, the legend-would-be...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141213	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141213	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141214	Even if it means I have to sacrifice who I am in return...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141214	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141214	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141215	I'm fine... Just... let me be alone for a while...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141215	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141215	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141299	Back then...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141299	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141299	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141301	Hey! Are you a new adventurer? Wanna join my brigade?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141301

DialogData_TalkContent_4015141303	Brigade?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141303

DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141304	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141305	I'm Jack, just Jack. We're all friends here.

DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141306	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141306	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141307	Especially those stories! Oh, they are so exciting and always get me pumped up!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141307	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141307	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141308	Hahaha... As for me, I only completed jobs like "dispose of the slimes that infested the sewers..."
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141308	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141308	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141309	*Sighs* When can I be like the others...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141309	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141309	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141310	Yeah, they usually band together in groups of four to go on adventures.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141310	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141310	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141311	You seem to be in good company.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141311	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141311	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141312	I once belonged to a rather nice brigade... But "The Unlucky Bennet" was also there...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141312	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141312	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141313	We all thought it was just a joke about him being "unlucky," but...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141313	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141313	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141314	All jobs he took on, somehow always failed in the least expected way...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141314	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141314	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141315	Come to think of it, it is rather strange.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141315	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141315	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141316	Ad astra abyssosque! May Lady Luck smiles upon you, friend.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141316

DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141401	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141401

DialogData_TalkContent_4015141403	What kind of liquor do you prefer?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141403	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141403	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141404	Goodbye.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141404

DialogData_TalkContent_4015141405	Really? Let me see... 8 beers, 5 wines, 7 ciders... Not so much!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141405	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141405	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141406	I'm no match for those legendary Mondstadt adventurers who can drink half of Cider Lake's worth of wine...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141406	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141406	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141407	Only a legend? Really? No wonder I couldn't figure out how they managed to buy so much wine...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141407	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141407	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141408	Me...? Beer? But not that I like it...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141408	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141408	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141409	It's just that... beggars can't be choosers...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141409	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141409	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141410	As long as it gets me drunk and high, it's good wine... Won't you agree?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141410	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015141410	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015141411	Laters! Have a good adventure!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015141411

DialogData_TalkContent_4015146706	It was way back when the Dawn Winery was just established when the owner of the winery opened this tavern.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015146706	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015146706	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015146707	The winery's owner, Diluc, still holds the deeds to Angel's Prescence. He really has taken the business to the next level.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015146707	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015146707	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015146708	The best in Mondstadt is a truth.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015146708	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015146708	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015146709	Diluc would serve the customers here personally when he's in a good mood, and let Charles off for a day or two.

DialogData_TalkContent_4015146710	If you see him here, do be respectful. He is the tycoon in Mondstadt, you know...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015146710	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015146710	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015146711	Mondstadt's climate, water, and crops are all perfect to make wine... I have to agree this is the blessings of the Anemo Archon!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015146711	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015146711	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015146712	Apple cider and cherry ciders all taste mighty nice--I forgot to mention dandelion cider! That's one of a kind!

DialogData_TalkContent_4015146713	By exporting to Liyue's trade unions, Mondstadt's wines are sold all over the continent.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015146713	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015146713	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015146714	They make good sales all over. Some even call it "bottled Mora."
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015146714	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015146714	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015146715	This must be why Dawn Winery's owner is so filthy rich...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015146715	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015146715	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015146716	Another advice... Don't touch any of the bottles here, no matter how plain it looks...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015146716	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015146716	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015146717	The bottle I broke happened to be the last owner's collector's item of a red wine... Do you see the villa to the north over there?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015146717	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015146717	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015146718	What I mean is, that wine costed as much as that villa.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015146718	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015146718	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015146719	By calculation, I need to work 48 more years to pay it all back... Sleeping and eating not included.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015146719	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015146719	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015146720	Well... It doesn't seem THAT hopeless if I think about it like that.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015146720	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015146720	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015146721	I need to get back to buying back my freedom... Hahaha... *Cough* *Sob*

DialogData_TalkTitle_4015147308	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015147308	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015147309	It's not the oldest building here.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015147309	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015147309	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015147310	In fact, in the times of aristocracy, the statue was once brought down and replaced by a tower.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015147310	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015147310	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015147311	After overthrowing the aristocrats, we hired the best mason in the Liyue Harbor.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015147311	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015147311	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015147312	We rebuilt the statue you see now according the look of Barbatos recorded in the literature.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015147312	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015147312	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015147313	When you stand in front of the statue, the wind will bring your prayers to Barbatos.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015147313	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015147313

DialogData_TalkTitle_4015147314	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015147314	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015147315	You can also pray to Barbatos by saying your wishes when the wind rises.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4015147315	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4015147315	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4015147316	The gentle Barbatos will take care of those with good heart.

DialogData_TalkTitle_4012000201	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4012000201	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4012000202	Who are you?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4012000202	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4012000202	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4012000203	I'm Connor, a winemaker of Dawn Winery's. I've been here since Master Crepus was still in charge.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4012000203	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4012000203	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4012000204	Master Crepus was also Master Diluc's father, the former owner of this winery.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4012000204	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4012000204	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4012000205	Unfortunately, Master Crepus died in his prime, and now the burden of running the winery falls on Master Diluc's shoulders...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4012000205	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4012000205	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4012000206	About winemaking...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4012000206	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4012000206	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4012000207	Dandelion wine is the house wine of our winery, offering the unique sweetish and refreshing taste, and rich in cereal aroma.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4012000207	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4012000207	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4012000208	As to how it is produced, I suggest you seek the answers in "On Beer Brewing" and "Distillation Technology."
DialogData_TalkTitle_4012000208	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4012000208	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4012000209	They are thoroughly written books and easy to find in the library. But Master Diluc has never read them, not even once...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4012000209	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4012000209	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4012000210	About Diluc
DialogData_TalkTitle_4012000210	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4012000210	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4012000211	Despite Master Diluc appears to have little interest in wine,
DialogData_TalkTitle_4012000211	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4012000211	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4012000212	I believe he bears the same talent in wine making just as his father did, only waiting to be inspired by an opportunity.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4012000212	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4012000212	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4012000213	The only question is, when will that opportunity come?

DialogData_TalkContent_4070101	Hey, Traveler! Wanna try catching crickets? It's a popular game in Lumia, you won't see this in Mondstadt!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4070101	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4070101	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4070102	Generally speaking, more often than not, the louder the cricket, the stronger it is.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4070102	
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4070102	
DialogData_TalkContent_4070201	Okay, I'll try.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4070201	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4070201	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4070301	Haven't caught any yet?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4070301	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4070301	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4070401	Time's up! Too bad, try harder next time.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4070401	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4070401	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4070501	Oh, this isn't bad. You caught one at least. Although I'm not sure whether this cricket is tough or not.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4070501	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4070501	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4080101	Ugh... My boyfriend asked me to solve a difficult problem. My head hurts just by thinking about it... Here it is: "<color=#00E1FFFF>You have 5 wood boards. Use them wisely to cross the river.</color>"
DialogData_TalkTitle_4080101	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4080101	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4080102	Arranging the 5 wood boards next to each other can only make me go half the distance. If you were to put space between them to reach the other side, the gap would be too big for me to jump across.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4080102	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4080102	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4080103	An <color=#00E1FFFF>adult man</color> could jump further... I guess I can't do it after all.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4080103	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4080103	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4080104	What do you think? How should we arrange them?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4080104	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4080104	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4080201	Arrange next to each other.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4080201	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4080201	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4080202	Are you sure? You'll barely manage to reach half the distance though.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4080202	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4080202	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4080203	Please wait a moment, I'll arrange them like you asked.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4080203	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4080203	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4080301	Arrange with gaps between them.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4080301	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4080301	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4080302	Are you sure? The gap between them would be very big to jump across.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4080302	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4080302	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4080303	Please wait a moment, I'll arrange them like you asked.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4080303	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4080303	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4080401	Let me think again...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4080401	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4080401	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4080402	Sure, no problem. I'll take the boards back.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4080402	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4080402	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4080501	I've made up my mind.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4080501	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4080501	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4080502	Here goes the challenge! Try to cross the river as quickly as possible! Ready... Go!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4080502	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4080502	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4080601	Quick! Don't waste time! Cross that river!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4080601	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4080601	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4080701	Awww... You couldn't reach the other side in time, just like me.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4080701	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4080701	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4080801	Wow! Incredible! Thanks to you, I can brag to my boyfriend now!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4080801	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4080801	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4080901	I'll practice a bit before trying.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4080901	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4080901	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4081001	How is it going? Are you ready to tackle the challenge?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4081001	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4081001	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4081101	If so, how should we arrange the boards?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4081101	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4081101	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4090101	Sorry, I'll try later...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4090101	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4090101	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4090201	I've been raising 3 slimes. They like to be lifted up in the air and especially enjoy jumping through hoops.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4090201	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4090201	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4090202	They go faster when you use Acting Grandmaster Jean's <color=#00E1FFFF>Gale Sword</color> though.\nHow about making the slimes jump through 10 hoops before time runs out! It's going to make them happy! Wanna try?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4090202	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4090202	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4090301	Sure.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4090301	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4090301	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4090302	Thank you! Now, please welcome <color=#00E1FFFF>Acting Grandmaster Jean</color>.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4090302	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4090302	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4090401	Use the <color=#00E1FFFF>Gale Sword</color> to make the slimes jump quicker! Time is running out!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4090401	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4090401	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4090501	That's too bad... You couldn't complete the challenge on time.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4090501	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4090501	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4090601	Congrats on completing the challenge! Thank you, my slimes had a lot of fun!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4090601	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4090601	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4090701	Acting Grandmaster Jean is prepared.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4090701	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4090701	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4090702	It's challenge time! Make the slimes jump through 10 hoops before time limit! Ready... Go!

DialogData_TalkContent_4180220	Hmm? Pardon me, I was lost in thought.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4180220	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4180220	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4180221	You! Amidst the valley flooded by monsters, I never thought I'd encounter another living being that's not a monster!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4180221	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4180221	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4180222	I am Livingstone, the great pioneering adventurer, and you must be one of my peers!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4180222	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4180222	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4180223	With the mysterious stars above and the brooding abyss below, this is what our adventurous souls are made of!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4180223	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4180223	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4180224	An ancient battlefield protected by <color=#00E1FFFF>triple seal barriers</color>, which were set up by the survivors using elemental powers to let their fallen comrades, their graves marked with swords, sleep undisturbed.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4180224	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4180224	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4180225	But... What should we do...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4180225	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4180225	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4180226	...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4180226	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4180226	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4180227	Sorry, I was lost in thought. Where were we?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4180227	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4180227	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4180230	"Undisturbed"
DialogData_TalkTitle_4180230	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4180230	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4180231	The seal?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4180231	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4180231	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4180232	Leave
DialogData_TalkTitle_4180232	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4180232	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4180240	Well, these swords...and the <color=#00E1FFFF>treasures</color> among them were the relics of the warriors who fought and died here. How could anyone let <color=#00E1FFFF>three Hilichurls camps</color> come rummaging and disturb their sleep?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4180240	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4180240	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4180241	We're not Hilichurls, so you can't pronounce what I'm doing as disturbing their sleep. We are adventurers who use their wits to conquer all mysteries and secrets!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4180241	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4180241	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4180242	I understand where you are coming from, but the <color=#00E1FFFF>seal</color>...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4180242	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4180242	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4180243	What should we do...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4180243	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4180243	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4180250	The seal?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4180250	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4180250	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4180251	Hilichurls camps?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4180251	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4180251	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4180252	Leave
DialogData_TalkTitle_4180252	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4180252	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4180260	Based on the flow of elemental forces, I, the great Livingstone, has successfully worked out the location of the seal which keeps the barriers intact!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4180260	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4180260	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4180261	<color=#00E1FFFF>Triple seal barriers</color> corresponds to <color=#00E1FFFF>three contraptions</color> located in the nearby <color=#00E1FFFF>three Hilichurls camps</color> respectively...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4180261	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4180261	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4180262	The <color=#00E1FFFF>Northern</color> Hilichurls camp matches the records of "Meaty Tribe" found in the works of great scholar Allen. They basically are a tribal race that loves nothing more than thick muscles and thick meat. They, unlike us, do not have the spirit that seeks wisdom!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4180262	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4180262	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4180263	The contraption is located on the <color=#00E1FFFF>great ring</color> where the "Meaty Tribe" test their strength against one another. I sneaked into their camp and was going to crack it open, but I didn't know that stepping onto the ring equals accepting their challenge. Quicker than words can tell, Hilichurls came flooding in...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4180263	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4180263	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4180264	*Whimper*
DialogData_TalkTitle_4180264	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4180264	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4180265	If we can teach them a lesson in fighting, we might have a chance at breaking the seal...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4180265	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4180265	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4180268	Other contraptions
DialogData_TalkTitle_4180268	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4180268	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4180269	Leave
DialogData_TalkTitle_4180269	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4180269	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4180270	The other contraption is located in the <color=#00E1FFFF>southern</color> camp of the "Sleepy Tribe." They are Hilichurls that <color=#00E1FFFF>sleep like logs when night falls</color>. Once again, they lack our hardworking spirit that never sleeps!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4180270	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4180270	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4180271	The contraption is located in the <color=#00E1FFFF>pool</color> in the camp. When I sneaked in under the dark, there was a huge Hilichurl with a shield...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4180271	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4180271	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4180272	<color=#00E1FFFF>Head west and climb up the hill</color>, and you will find the camp of the "Black Sun Tribe." According to the records, they are rigid followers of Shaman traditions. They do not bear the same adventurous spirit of breaking all molds like we do!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4180272	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4180272	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4180273	The contraption is at the <color=#00E1FFFF>center of the camp</color>. The contraption is not only surrounded by Black Sun Shaman though, Abyss Mages can be found alongside them...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4180273	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4180273	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4180274	I, Livingstone, the adventurer bearing the wisdom that could match the stars and the courage to embrace all ruins, lacks only the brute force to triumph over them!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4180274	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4180274	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4180275	Sorry to hear that.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4180275	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4180275	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4180276	Leave
DialogData_TalkTitle_4180276	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4180276	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4180280	You feel sorry for me too, don't you?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4180280	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4180280	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4180281	But wrong! In the dictionary of adventurers, there is no such phrase as "feeling sorry"!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4180281	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4180281	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4180282	Only the phrase "not enough effort"! We must exert our utmost efforts to not leave any regrets! The stars and the abyss are waiting for us, young adventurer!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4180282	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4180282	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4180283	A pity that there are things that can never be achieved even for a person who bears the Livingstone name...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4180283	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4180283	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4180284	Defeat <color=#00E1FFFF>the three Hilichurls camps and lift the three seal contraptions</color>... You can't achieve such things without brute force no matter how adventurous you are!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4180284	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4180284	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4180285	Oh! I am dying, so very dying to see what <color=#00E1FFFF>treasures</color> lie behind the seal barriers!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4180285	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4180285	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4180286	If you are a true adventurer and believe you have the wisdom and courage to match anyone, then take up the challenge!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4180286	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4180286	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4180287	But my fellow adventurer, take good care of yourself!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4180287	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4180287	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4180288	Do not let yourself be reduced to bones that sleep in desolation when there are still infinite mysteries in our world to behold!

DialogData_TalkContent_4260102	I want to do a quest
DialogData_TalkTitle_4260102

DialogData_TalkTitle_4260103	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4260103

DialogData_TalkTitle_4260104

DialogData_TalkContent_4260105	I want to look around
DialogData_TalkTitle_4260105

DialogData_TalkTitle_4260113	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4260113	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4260114	Weapons and Artifacts can also be improved and ascended.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4260114	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4260114	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4260115	But you'll have to figure out the rest of it by yourself.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4260115	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4260115	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4260116	Almost forgot, the level of characters are also very important.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4260116

DialogData_TalkTitle_4610102	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610102	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610103	You usually don't lose your chill.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610103	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610103	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610104	Oh, thank the thousand winds! {NICKNAME}, your arrival must be the grace of Archons!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610104	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610104	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610105	If I may ask, the envoy sent by the Anemo Archon to save us mere mortals, could you spare a moment?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610105	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610105	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610106	Ewwww, cut it out!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610106	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610106	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610107	Can't say I don't have the moment...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610107	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610107	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610108	Marvelous!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610108	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610108	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610109	Tell me what happened.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610109	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610109	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610110	I cannot let my peers hear of this! I cannot seek help from anyone else but you.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610110	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610110	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610111	Please, let us move to somewhere more fit for such conversations...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610111	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610111	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610112	I suggest you leave for the courtyard that's not far from our headquarters with me.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610112	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610112	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610113	What's with the sneakiness... 
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610113	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610113	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610201	This place will do.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610201	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610201	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610202	Tell us what it's about already!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610202	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610202	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610203	How should I begin... Oh, right, let me tell you a secret first.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610203	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610203	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610204	It is a secret of my past and I confide in you to keep it.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610204	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610204	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610205	Don't worry, my lips are as tight as can be.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610205	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610205	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610206	As a matter of fact... My grandfather was a pirate!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610206	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610206	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610207	Oh.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610207	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610207	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610208	... Wait, why do you sound so blithe? Do you think I'm making it up?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610208	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610208	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610209	Look at my eye patch! I inherited it from my grandfather and this is solid proof that we are related by blood!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610209	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610209	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610210	I never knew you could inherit eye patches.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610210	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610210	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610211	My! {NICKNAME}, how could you not know such common knowledge!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610211	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610211	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610212	This is no different than children inheriting their hairstyles from their parents!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610212	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610212	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610213	How surprising.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610213	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610213	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610214	Yesterday I was glancing through the notes my grandfather left, and stumbled upon records that spoke of <color=#00E1FFFF>treasures</color>...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610214	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610214	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610215	... Treasures!?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610215	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610215	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610216	According to his notes, the treasures are buried in the "Lost Arcadia Ruins."
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610216	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610216	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610217	Treasures...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610217	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610217	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610218	But its whereabouts is currently unknown, though I've tried searching for clues...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610218	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610218	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610219	Treasures!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610219	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610219	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610220	Kaeya! What kind of treasures are they, are they gold? Or better yet, gems!?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610220	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610220	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610221	Hmph! Treasures that consist of nothing but gold and gems are third-rate treasures...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610221	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610221	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610222	My grandfather's treasure is a "sword"!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610222	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610222	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610223	A magic sword that grants the wielder unrivaled power!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610223	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610223	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610224	Oh wowwwww!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610224	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610224	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610225	The sword was dropped by a Archon from Celestia into the sea, and was salvaged by my grandfather's crew by pure coincidence.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610225	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610225	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610226	The moment he gripped the sword, thunders roared, billows howled, and the clear skies were suddenly swallowed by raging winds...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610226	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610226	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610227	With the might of the magic sword, my grandfather went on to defeat a hydra, a silver-haired banshee, a wicked abyss dragon...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610227	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610227	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610228	But the immense power of the sword allured many more avaricious pirates.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610228	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610228	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610229	To avoid meaningless conflict, my grandfather hid the magic sword.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610229	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610229	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610230	Hydra, silver-haired banshee... Do they really exist?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610230	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610230	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610231	The world we live in is fascinating because it's full of unknown and inexplicable wonders.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610231	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610231	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610232	...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610232	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610232	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610233	These incredibly thrilling adventures are romances that could only be told by pirates, don't you agree?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610233	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610233	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610234	Holly molly! That's just insane!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610234	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610234	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610235	A gang of <color=#00E1FFFF>treasure thieves</color> are very active lately and many ruins have had their relics stolen by them.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610235	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610235	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610236	I fret that they will soon discover the "Arcadia Ruins," and the magic sword will be lost...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610236	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610236	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610237	We won't let it fall into the wrong hands! We must procure the sword before them...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610237	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610237	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610238	... You just rest assured that {NICKNAME} and I are here to help!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610238	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610238	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610239	Really!?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610239	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610239	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610240	Great! Do keep it a secret please. I'll wait for your good news!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610240	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610240	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610241	Hey! So whatcha think, {NICKNAME}? Isn't it exciting? I mean, I mean, that's like a super duper powerful sword!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610241	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610241	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610242	Is it true?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610242	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610242	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610243	Is it really true?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610243	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610243	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610244	Well... How about let's go to the <color=#00E1FFFF>Adventurer's Guild</color> and see if we can learn more?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610244	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610244	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610245	The adventurers should know more about the ruins, right?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610245	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610245	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610401	Oh, what is it? You want to join the Guild?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610401	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610401	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610402	We just happen to have an opening for a good chef...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610402	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610402	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610403	We're looking for...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610403	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610403	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610404	Humph! We're not here for something that mundane!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610404	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610404	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610405	We're looking for an uber powerful sword...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610405	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610405	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610406	that fell from Celestia, slew the 8-headed banshee and the silver-haired hydra!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610406	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610406	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610407	It's the 8-headed hydra and the silver-haired banshee...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610407	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610407	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610408	That's what I said! A super epic sword!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610408	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610408	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610409	Anyany, as long as I don't tell them the treasure's location!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610409	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610409	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610410	You said too much.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610410	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610410	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610411	It's fine! As long as I don't tell them the treasure's location!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610411	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610411	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610412	So, Cyrus, you know where is this Lost Arcadia Ruins supposed to be?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610412	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610412	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610413	(Now she's done it...)
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610413	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610413	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610414	Arcadia Ruins... Never head of it.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610414	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610414	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610415	Thanks for your the intel anyway. If you do find it, I'd love to see it.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610415	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610415	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610429	...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610429	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610429	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610416	Ugh...my...intel...?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610416	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610416	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4611101	About the Arcadia Ruins
DialogData_TalkTitle_4611101	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4611101	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4611201	I am interested in it, but I just don't have the intel for you.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4611201	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4611201	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610501	Hey there. You're here for my stories, aren't you?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610501	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610501	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610513	No. We're here for...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610513	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610513	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610502	Nope. We're just want to know if you've been to Arcadia Ruins?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610502	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610502	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610503	Arcadia Ruins? Imagine that... There's a place that I haven't been to...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610503	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610503	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610504	Oh? Even the great Stanley doesn't know?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610504	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610504	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610505	Never mind this Arcadia... You need to know what happened to me at the Ashen Sea and the Geyer Realm...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610505	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610505	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610506	We don't have time for your stories. Think hard please. We need clues.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610506	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610506	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610507	The Ashen Sea... It was a place of death...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610507	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610507	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610508	Gosh...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610508	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610508	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610509	When we find the <color=#00E1FFFF>treasure</color>, the "Treasure of Arcadia" will definitely be better than your stupid stories!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610509	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610509	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610510	(She just said it out loud...)
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610510	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610510	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610511	Treasure...?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610511	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610511	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610512	Hmph! It's a waste of time talking to him. Let's go already.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610512	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610512	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4611301	About the Arcadia Ruins
DialogData_TalkTitle_4611301	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4611301	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4611302	If you are not here for my stories, we have nothing to talk about.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4611302	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4611302	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610601	Hey! Are you a new adventurer? Wanna join my brigade?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610601	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610601	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610612	I'd like to ask...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610612	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610612	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610602	Hey! Do you have any intel on the Arcadia Ruins?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610602	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610602	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610603	Arcadia... Can't say I've heard of it. Sorry, I'm still new here, so...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610603	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610603	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610604	I see...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610604	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610604	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610605	But you can try posting a job and see if there are any vets who know about it.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610605	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610605	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610606	Nono, no way.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610606	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610606	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610607	We can't afford them beating us to the treasure!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610607	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610607	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610608	(She just said it out loud...)
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610608	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610608	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610609	I see!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610609	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610609	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610610	Well then, I'll keep a lookout for your treasure--I mean, your Arcadia ruins.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610610	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610610	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4611401	About the Arcadia Ruins
DialogData_TalkTitle_4611401	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4611401	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4611402	Should I go look for it as well...? Oh, haha! I'm just joking. I hope you guys find it!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4611402	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4611402	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610701	Still no clues...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610701	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610701	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610702	Well, it's not like it's gonna be easy! I mean, it's the hiding place of the super amazing sword!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610702	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610702	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610703	Anyway, we should go meet up with Kaeya first.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610703	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610703	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610801	Oh, you're back. Do you have news for me?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610801	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610801	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610802	Listen, we asked around the Adventurer's Guild, and found... Well, nothing.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610802	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610802	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610803	Haha... That much is expected.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610803	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610803	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610804	Hmm?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610804	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610804	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610805	Oh, I only mean that, what's the fun in finding it without the hard work?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610805	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610805	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610806	However, I do have some clues.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610806	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610806	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610807	I sent someone to get some black market intel... It seems that someone does know about the Arcadia Ruins.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610807	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610807	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610808	Really? Where's the guy?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610808	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610808	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610809	Now, now, as per the black market's rules, they will send someone to meet us to prevent leaks.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610809	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610809	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610810	We will be meeting the informant at the Whispering Woods.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610810	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610810	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610811	Then, what are we waiting for here?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610811	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610811	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610812	It's not ideal for Kaeya to show his face.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610812	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610812	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610813	That's right. You read my mind.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610813	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610813	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610814	I am a knight...so I shouldn't have any dealings with the black market.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610814	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610814	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610815	We'll get the intel back to you.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610815	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610815	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610816	You have my thanks.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610816	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610816	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610817	Of course, you'll be compensated for your troubles...by the Knights.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610817	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610817	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610818	Hehe, no problemo!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610818	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610818	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4610901	I'm a bit busy right now. Do try to find more...clues... You know what I mean.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4610901	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4610901	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4611001	Help... Help!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4611001	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4611001	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620101	Look, {NICKNAME}! She's in trouble!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620101	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620101	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620102	Forget about the informant. Let's save her!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620102	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620102	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620201	...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620201	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620201	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620301	Why is thing happening to me... I shouldn't have helped <color=#00E1FFFF>him</color>...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620301	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620301	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620302	Him, who?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620302	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620302	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620303	Thanks so much for saving me! You're far more reliable than those Fatuus guys.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620303	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620303	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620304	No prob. But {NICKNAME} here is also an Honorary Knight of Favonius.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620304	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620304	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620305	Honorary Knight? So, it's you. I didn't think I'd be saved by <color=#00E1FFFF>the one I'm here to meet</color>.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620305	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620305	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620306	Oh, so you are the...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620306	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620306	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620307	Hahaha... I didn't know how I can pay you back initially, but now, I think I'll just give you the intel for free.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620307	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620307	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620308	People in our circle knows how important the network is.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620308	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620308	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620309	Really?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620309	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620309	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620310	Well, you did save my life.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620310	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620310	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620311	Thank you, friend.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620311	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620311	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620312	Lucky!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620312	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620312	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620313	But...it's lucky for Kaeya, isn't it? He's supposed to pay for the intel...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620313	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620313	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620314	Listen well then, the intel on the Arcadia Ruins...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620314	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620314	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620315	"Three Six-Armed Giants reside in the city in the lake. Two guard the statue, one, the treasure."
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620315	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620315	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620316	Right... Wait, is that it?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620316	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620316	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620325	There's also this map that came with it.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620325	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620325	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620317	Could...this be the X-marks-the-spot?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620317	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620317	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620318	So the clue is more like a riddle...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620318	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620318	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620319	Should be a piece of cake for ya, isn't it, {NICKNAME}? I'll leave it to you then!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620319	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620319	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620320	Sure thing.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620320	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620320	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620321	Sure... I hope.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620321	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620321	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620322	Well, if you can't solve it, we can ask Kaeya. He seems like a nerd too.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620322	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620322	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620326	I'll leave you the intel so you can review it any time.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620326	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620326	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620327	Thanks, Val.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620327	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620327	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620323	"Three Six-Armed Giants reside in the city in the lake. Two guard the statue, one, the treasure."
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620323	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620323	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620324	What does it mean? If you don't wanna ask Kaeya, you better figure it out!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620324	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620324	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620401	Let me see what it holds!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620401	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620401	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620402	"She doesn't love him. The overflowing passion is but a visage that she only removes when in utter loneliness."
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620402	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620402	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620407	There's another map.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620407	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620407	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620403	More riddles?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620403	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620403	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620404	I'm dizzy already. Oh, no! I used up all my brain juice!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620404	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620404	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620405	You never had any to begin with...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620405	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620405	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620406	I'll let you have all the fun. Or, you could get Kaeya to share in on it.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620406	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620406	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620501	{NICKNAME}! You're back! Looks like you got the intel.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620501	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620501	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620502	Yes and no. It's a lot more complicated than that.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620502	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620502	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620503	"Three Six-Armed Giants reside in the city in the lake. Two guard the statue, one, the treasure." What do you make of it?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620503	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620503	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620504	Riddles? How quaint. Let me think...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620504	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620504	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620505	"City in the lake" surely is Mondstadt... As for the Six-Armed Giant... Hmm...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620505	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620505	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620506	Crabs?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620506	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620506	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620507	Giant crabs!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620507	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620507	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620508	Aside from where we can find giant crabs...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620508	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620508	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620509	Crabs have 8 legs, not 6...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620509	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620509	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620516	The windmills, then?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620516	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620516	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620517	Should be...the windmills?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620517	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620517	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620518	Hey! That's smart!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620518	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620518	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620519	A windmill has 6 blades... It fits.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620519	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620519	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620510	Wow! That makes sense!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620510	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620510	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620511	So, out of the 3 windmills, two is close to the statue...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620511	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620511	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620512	The other one is guarding the...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620512	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620512	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620513	The treasure! This I know!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620513	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620513	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620514	Hehehe... Let's hope it's really that simple.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620514	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620514	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620515	Come on, {NICKNAME}! Let's go have a look at that windmill!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620515	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620515	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620601	Hehe, to a genius like me, this is nothing. Take a look at this map!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620601	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620601	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620701	"She doesn't love him at all. The passion rushing through the clear spring is just a front. When she's cold and alone, her true heart is revealed."
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620701	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620701	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620702	Any idea what it means?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620702	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620702	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620703	Is this some page stripped from a love novel that you just happened to find?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620703	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620703	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620704	Oh, it seems I was wrong, it makes sense now that someone as clever as me wasn't able to guess.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620704	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620704	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620705	Hahaha... I'm just joking.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620705	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620705	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620706	Hmph... Take this more seriously, Kaeya!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620706	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620706	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620707	Haha, this riddle is hard to figure out. Clear spring... Is it referring to Springvale?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620707	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620707	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620708	"Passion rushing through the clear spring..." So when does passion rush through a clear spring?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620708	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620708	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620717	Maybe when there's people bathing in the spring water?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620717	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620717	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620718	...This kind of corruption, I feel like it has been creeping in Mondstadt for quite a while now.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620718	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620718	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620719	Unless...this is your hobby?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620719	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620719	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620720	Oh, my apologies. I shouldn't judge how one spends their free time.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620720	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620720	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620721	What's wrong with you? What kind of person do you think {NICKNAME} is?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620721	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620721	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620722	Haha. The thing is, if the "passion rush" isn't coming from the clear spring, then it's coming from the people bathing.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620722	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620722	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620723	Hmm... Maybe it's when the water level of the clear spring changes?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620723	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620723	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620724	When the water level changes?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620724	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620724	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620725	Not a bad idea! Like when...there's a waterfall for example...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620725	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620725	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620726	It appears the solution to this enigma hides in the waterfall behind the mountain of Springvale.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620726	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620726	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620727	Only the clear spring that blesses Mondstadt can reveal the passion described here.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620727	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620727	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620709	And the "Heart of the Waterfall" must refer to the cliff on the left side of the waterfall, I noticed it when I looked over while patrolling in the area.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620709	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620709	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620710	The ending "Cold and alone" probably has something to do with the Vision being able to control Cryo.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620710	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620710	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620711	You should probably <color=#00E1FFFF>bring someone who has Cryo powers with you</color>.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620711	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620711	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620712	Thanks for the help Kaeya.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620712	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620712	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620713	That's not enough, if a Knight of Favonius can't even guess a riddle, how can we be sure you can solve criminal mysteries?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620713	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620713	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620714	Let's go take a look at the clear spring, we'll leave you to your "criminal mysteries!"
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620714	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620714	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620715	...Huh?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620715	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620715	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620716	Hum, I mean, leave you to SOLVING criminal mysteries!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620716	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620716	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620801	Location is in the Whispering Woods, you haven't forgotten right?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620801	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620801	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4620901	If I'm right, the location described by the clue is the mill the furthest away from the statue... I'm not completely certain though.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4620901	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4620901	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4621001	Let's go look around the waterfall near Springvale, remember to bring a friend who has Cryo powers. Huh? Oh... Me...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4621001	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4621001	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4621101	"Three Six-Armed Giants reside in the city in the lake. Two guard the statue, one, the treasure." Got it?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4621101	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4621101	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630001	This time, the mysteries have all been solved, it sure took a lot of work.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630001	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630001	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630014	But in all fairness, this treasure map really is terrible... It sure seems like it was drawn by a pirate.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630014	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630014	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630002	So now...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630002	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630002	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630003	Let's report to Kaeya first.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630003	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630003	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630004	Hum? Paimon believes that, there, is, no, need.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630004	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630004	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630005	Let's go to the treasure location directly!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630005	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630005	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630006	You read my mind! I'm so happy!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630006	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630006	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630007	Let's go for it! Don't want anyone else to get there before we do!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630007	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630007	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630008	Like...like the Treasure Thieves Kaeya told us about.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630008	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630008	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630009	Anyway, I just want to get the sword to...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630009	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630009	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630010	Nono! I mean, just wanna see it!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630010	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630010	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630011	Definitely not to become super mega powerful and do nothing but play...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630011	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630011	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630012	Alright, I'll save the chit-chat for later.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630012	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630012	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630013	Arcadia Treasure Hunt, here we go!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630013	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630013	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630101	This must be the Arcadia Ruins.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630101	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630101	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630102	Is it just me, or does it look...plain.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630102	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630102	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630103	I know! The perfect disguise is always in plain sight!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630103	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630103	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630104	Kaeya's grandpa sure is impressive.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630104	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630104	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630105	(Rustling sounds)
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630105	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630105	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630106	Listen, Paimon...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630106	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630106	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630107	Mice.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630107	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630107	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630108	You didn't try, did you?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630108	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630108	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630109	It's no time to get suspicious. We're close!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630109	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630109	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630110	Hurry! The treasure is waiting for us!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630110	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630110	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630301	Ugh... Is this the end?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630301	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630301	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630302	Where are you, my treasure!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630302	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630302	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630303	Let's look around, {NICKNAME}.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630303	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630303	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630304	Hahaha... I'll save you the troubles.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630304	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630304	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630305	How about you let me take over?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630305	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630305	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630306	The Treasure Thieves?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630306	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630306	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630307	Sharp eye, but too slow.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630307	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630307	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630308	The black market?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630308	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630308	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630309	Well, I did have dealings with them.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630309	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630309	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630310	But they are stupid people of principles... Losers.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630310	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630310	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630311	I'm Izzard.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630311	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630311	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630312	I thank you two on the behalf of the Treasure Thieves.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630312	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630312	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630313	Ugh...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630313	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630313	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630314	We've been keeping a low profile, how did the info get out?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630314	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630314	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630315	I'm not surprised at all.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630315	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630315	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630316	Humph! I won't let you have the treasure without a fight!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630316	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630316	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630317	Underestimating us is not good for your heart.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630317	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630317	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630318	My colleagues are just outside waiting for my order.

DialogData_TalkContent_4630320	(Kaeya and the Knights of Favonius enter)
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630320	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630320	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630321	I'm sorry to drop a cold bucket on you.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630321	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630321	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630322	As for your colleagues, what can I say?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630322	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630322	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630323	You can visit them...in Mondstadt's prison.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630323	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630323	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630324	Better yet, you can move in as their roommate.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630324	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630324	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630325	The Knights...?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630325	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630325	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630326	Hey, it's Kaeya!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630326	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630326	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630327	Kaeya, he wants to steal your treasure! Get him!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630327	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630327	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630328	Tsk... I almost had it...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630328	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630328	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630329	Oh, you mean the treasure?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630329	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630329	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630330	Sorry, but there isn't any treasture to begin with.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630330	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630330	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630331	You came all the way...for nothing. Just give it up.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630331	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630331	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630332	Huh?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630332	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630332	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630333	No...treasure?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630333	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630333	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630334	Did Kaeya just say, there isn't any treasure?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630334	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630334	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630335	Hahaha! You got me good. Didn't think the Favonius would resort to such schemes.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630335	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630335	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630336	A thief is has no right to criticize the method of the Knights--Wait, what are you...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630336	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630336	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630337	You're not gonna get me!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630337	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630337	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630338	Wha... What is this? I didn't mean it!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630338	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630338	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630339	Tsk... What a troublemaker.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630339	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630339	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630340	You! Knight! You're not gonna watch me die, are ya?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630340	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630340	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630341	That actually is a good suggestion.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630341	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630341	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630342	Fine! I'll confess and submit myself to you! Please, just help me!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630342	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630342	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630343	Alright then. Guess I will have to do some overtime work after all.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630343	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630343	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630501	Shame on me for having my life saved by a Knight...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630501	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630501	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630502	Don't forget what you just promised... Or that thing would be the least of your worries.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630502	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630502	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630503	Hey... Is this how the Knights of Favonius treat their suspects?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630503	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630503	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630504	I'm just joking. Alright... Let's take him back.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630504	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630504	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630505	Sir, yes sir!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630505	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630505	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630506	Quartermaster, should we take those two in as well?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630506	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630506	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630507	What?!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630507	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630507	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630508	Haha, of course not. They are the ones who made this arrest possible.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630508	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630508	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630509	Without them spreading our <color=#00E1FFFF>fabricated intel</color>, we wouldn't be able to catch the Treasure Thieves.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630509	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630509	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630534	Yes sir!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630534	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630534	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630510	So the intel is fake.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630510	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630510	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630511	There is no treasure.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630511	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630511	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630512	I was deceived! Gosh!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630512	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630512	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630513	*Cry* You're a bad man for lying to me... Shame on the Knights!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630513	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630513	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630514	Alright, alright... Stop it already.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630514	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630514	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630515	Though the treasure doesn't exist, you did want it for your own, didn't you?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630515	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630515	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630516	Otherwise, why wouldn't you inform us of your actions?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630516	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630516	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630517	I... I... Humph!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630517	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630517	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630518	Let's go, {NICKNAME}. I'm done talking to him!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630518	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630518	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630519	Ha. Just a sec.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630519	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630519	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630520	You did help me out, so you do deserve a reward.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630520	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630520	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630521	This is the "Dawn-Slashing and Victory-Pointing Sword of Triumph." As its name suggests, it symbolizes light and victory.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630521	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630521	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630533	If you don't mind, I would like to present you with this Harbringer of Dawn as a reward.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630533	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630533	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630522	Harbringer of Dawn?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630522	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630522	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630523	That's right. It fits a well-cultured and disciplined lady like you, wouldn't you say so? Ms. Paimon?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630523	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630523	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630524	Well... if the reward is this Harbringer of Dawn...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630524	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630524	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630525	You'd forgive me, right?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630525	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630525	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630526	I'm honored to have such an understanding friend.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630526	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630526	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630527	Yes...yes...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630527	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630527	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630528	You have my apologies about my deception. I will not use the same method twice.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630528	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630528	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630529	... Paimon has been completely charmed.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630529	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630529	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630530	Means you'll use a different method the next time?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630530	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630530	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630535	What surprise that you have solved the puzzles all by yourselves and appeared before me.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630535	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630535	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630536	So it was you who left all those clues?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630536	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630536	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630537	Indeed. However, even I believed the clues were too vague to be of any help to you.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630537	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630537	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630538	I was prepared to answer your questions...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630538	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630538	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630539	Quite impressive. This was my only source of amazement during the entire operation.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630539	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630539	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630540	Hah! That was nothing!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630540	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630540	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630541	It was a cakewalk!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630541	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630541	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630542	Uh, actually, I tapped into other sources for help...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630542	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630542	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630543	No matter what you say, I have acknowledged your wisdom. After all, wisdom itself does not deceive.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630543	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630543	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630544	But some people do enjoy deceiving others with their wits!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630544	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630544	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630545	Hahaha...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630545	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4630545	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4630531	What a wonderful day. Now, I have to go interrogate my suspect...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4630531

DialogData_TalkContent_4680204	Now is the ripening season for grapes. But a herd of boars came out of nowhere and they have their eyes set on the vineyard.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4680204	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4680204	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4680205	I can't chase them away by myself and my son is not with me now, so all I can do now is to watch them wrecking my land...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4680205	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4680205	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4680206	If you can help me kick these boars out, I'll repay you handsomely!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4680206	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4680206	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4680301	I've got something else to do...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4680301	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4680301	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4680302	Well then, guess I can only wait until my son's back to punish those boars.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4680302	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4680302	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4680401	Hello. Do you have any message from my son?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4680401	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4680401	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4680501	There are still some boars wandering there...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4680501	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4680501	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4680601	Who are you?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4680601	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4680601	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4680602	Me? Pals in the winery call me old Turner. I'm a farmer here at the Dawn Winery.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4680602	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4680602	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4680603	My family have been farming here for generations. Most of the good wine you've had were probably fermented using the grapes here.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4680603	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4680603	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4680604	Every owner of the winery has been treating our family very generously.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4680604	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4680604	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4680605	But I don't think it's a good thing for my son to inherit this land and become a farmer for his whole life...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4680605	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4680605	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4680701	Your son?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4680701	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4680701	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4680702	Gale! He's name is Gale, my beloved son!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4680702	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4680702	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4680703	What? You've never heard of him? Hahaha, that's fine. Sooner or later, you'll know him. The whole Mondstadr will know him...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4680703	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4680703	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4680704	My son, Gale, told me he was going to be the strongest Knight of Favonius! I believe in him.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4680704	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4680704	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4680705	I spent all my hard-earned money for his sake, to give him a better future than mine.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4680705	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4680705	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4680706	Gale is determined to fulfill his dream! He became an squire at 16, so our household has been relying on him since.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4680706	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4680706	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4680801	Goodbye
DialogData_TalkTitle_4680801	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4680801	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4680802	Goodbye! If you meet my son, please tell him to come home once in a while!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4680802	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4680802	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4690001	It's a Statue of the Seven!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4690001	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4690001	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4690002	Look at {NICKNAME}'s offerings. I wonder if the Archons will answer them...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4690002	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4690002	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4690003	Wow, so it's this thing that feels like consolidated wind...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4690003	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4690003	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4690004	{NICKNAME}, let's head back to the Statue of The Seven at Windrise and offer it to the Archons!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4690004	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4690004	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4690005	Well... You should come with me, I'll tell you about the rest later.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4690005	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4690005	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4690101	Can you feel the blessings of the Seven?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4690101	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4690101	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4690102	Keep offering Statue's Eyes of Wind, and maybe you'll receive more blessings!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4690102	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4690102	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4690201	Can you feel the blessings of the Seven?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4690201	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4690201	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4690202	In Mondstadt, people refer to consolidated wind as the "Lost Statue's Eye of Wind."
DialogData_TalkTitle_4690202	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4690202	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4690203	It can be fitted into the statue's eyes.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4690203	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4690203	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4690204	Some stories say a swallow took its original eye-gems.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4690204	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4690204	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4690205	But "Lost Statue's Eye of Wind" never had physical forms from the start.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4690205	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4690205	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4690206	That kind of elemental energy could not be sensed by most. It wouldn't change the statue's appearance even when offered to Archons.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4690206	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4690206	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4690207	People with Visions collect them for the Statue of The Seven to get blessings.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4690207	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4690207	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4690208	Although you don't have the Vision, you are detached from the common rules of this world...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4690208	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4690208	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4690209	Keep offering Statue's Eyes of Wind, and maybe you'll receive more blessings!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4690209	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4690209	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4700101	Ahh! Am I smelling what I think I'm smelling?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4700101	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4700101	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4700102	It's Sautéed Matsutake!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4700102	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4700102	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4700103	Hmmm! The aroma is coming from Deer Hunter!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4700103	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4700103	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4700104	Fresh from the pan, steaming hot... Melted butter...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4700104	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4700104	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4700105	The pungent smell of spices... The lightly browned edges of pan-seared Matsutake...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4700105	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4700105	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4700106	I've made my mind!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4700106	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4700106	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4700107	It's an emergency! We must head for <color=#00E1FFFF>Deer Hunter</color> and order ourselves a generous plate of <color=#00E1FFFF>Sautéed Matsutake</color>!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4700107	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4700107	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4700108	It's on you, of course!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4700108	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4700108	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4700201	Om nom nom! It's so delicious!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4700201	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4700201	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4700202	Deer Hunter's Sautéed Matsutake is the best!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4700202	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4700202	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4700203	This might surprise you, but Buttered Matsutake Mushroom is actually a classic traditional recipe in Mondstadt that anyone can cook.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4700203	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4700203	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4700204	You can try cooking it yourself if you have the ingredients.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4700204	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4700204	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4700205	Can the culinary expertise of {NICKNAME} surpass that of Deer Hunter's?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4700205	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4700205	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4700206	Why, I would love to be your personal taste tester!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4700206	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4700206

DialogData_TalkTitle_4842302	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4842302	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4842303	Huh? If that bird monster did enter the village, it would have entered through the village entrance...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4842303	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4842303	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4842305	Looks like it isn't here. Let's go check out the other parts of the village!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4842305	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4842305	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4842307	Excuse me, have you seen anyone suspicious pass the village?

DialogData_TalkTitle_4842308	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4842308	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4842309	Hmm. If that bird monster did enter the village, someone would have seen it...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4842309

DialogData_TalkContent_4842310	Excuse me, have you seen anyone suspicious pass the village?
DialogData_TalkTitle_4842310

DialogData_TalkTitle_4842311	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4842311	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4842313	Suspicious... If he didn't see the bird, does that mean our initial inference was wrong? That the bird monster didn't leave Springvale to begin with...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4842313	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4842313	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4842314	Let's go ask the other villagers.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4842314	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4842314	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4842316	Wait! I hear something coming from outside the village!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4842316	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4842316	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4842317	Someone is under attack!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4842317	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4842317	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4842318	Could it possibly be...the bird? Come on, let's go!
DialogData_TalkTitle_4842318	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4842318	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4843101	Damn, we're too late. Judging from the injuries, it appears to be the works of that bird monster.
DialogData_TalkTitle_4843101	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4843101	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4843102	The victim must have seen where the bird fled to draw its attention. Now we've lost our final trail...
DialogData_TalkTitle_4843102	 
DialogData_TalkRoleName_4843102	 
DialogData_TalkContent_4843103	It seems that our initial deduction was incorrect. The bird did not escape to Springvale, since it would have been easily spotted by the townsfolk... As Outriders, we must make the correct deduction. This is an important lesson!

DungeonReminderData_Content_2	Ugh! Don't scare me!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1001001	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1001001	This huge door seems heavy... Can it even be opened?
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1001002	Amber
DungeonReminderData_Content_1001002	Well, we can unlock the gate with that console.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1001003	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1001003	Wha- How does that work?
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1001004	Amber
DungeonReminderData_Content_1001004	According to Lisa, the people that once lived here have some incomprehensible technology.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1001005	Amber
DungeonReminderData_Content_1001005	I've got no clue how it works, but if you're interested you can go to the<color=#00E1FFFF>Adventurer's Association</color> later and ask around.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1002001	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1002001	I can see... deep into the temple!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1003001	Amber
DungeonReminderData_Content_1003001	For a well trained scout, just <color=#00E1FFFF>one shot</color> can take down an enemy!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1004001	Amber
DungeonReminderData_Content_1004001	Finally they're rid of, good job!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1005001	Amber
DungeonReminderData_Content_1005001	Oh, look. There's a <color=#00E1FFFF>pile of leaves</color> over there! I know just how to use them!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1005002	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1005002	Being able to light a fire whenever and wherever sure is handy.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1005003	Amber
DungeonReminderData_Content_1005003	Hey! Don't go making out that I'm a box of matches!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1006001	Amber
DungeonReminderData_Content_1006001	The win is always Amber's! Let's go claim our reward from the treasure chest!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1006002	Amber
DungeonReminderData_Content_1006002	And then we can use that Teleportation Stone to head home!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1007001	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1007001	It's so damp here!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1007002	Kaeya
DungeonReminderData_Content_1007002	<color=#00E1FFFF>Wet</color> monsters? Great, let me <color=#00E1FFFF>freeze</color> them forever!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1008001	Kaeya
DungeonReminderData_Content_1008001	There's a suspicious-looking person over there, let's go ask!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1009001	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1009001	*Sigh* Well, we're finally here.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1009002	Kaeya
DungeonReminderData_Content_1009002	There's no road left to take. Let's use the <color=#00E1FFFF>wind currents</color> to go up.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1009003	Kaeya
DungeonReminderData_Content_1009003	 
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1010001	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1010001	Water! Can we use this to put out fire?
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1010002	Kaeya
DungeonReminderData_Content_1010002	Good idea, that's some keen observation.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1010003	Kaeya
DungeonReminderData_Content_1010003	Would be better to let Jean give you a title and become a knight.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1010004	Kaeya
DungeonReminderData_Content_1010004	Traveler... You wouldn't happen to have a Vision, would you?
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1010005	Kaeya
DungeonReminderData_Content_1010005	Then how exactly is it that you're able to use elemental energy?
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1010006	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1010006	It's a very strange.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1010007	Kaeya
DungeonReminderData_Content_1010007	Speaking of which, did you know?
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1010008	Kaeya
DungeonReminderData_Content_1010008	Stormterror was once one of the Four Winds.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1010009	Kaeya
DungeonReminderData_Content_1010009	I'm not aware of the exact details. If you're interested you can ask the Acting Grandmaster about it.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1010010	Amber
DungeonReminderData_Content_1010010	This is the danger you put you put yourself in sleeping next to fireplaces.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1011001	Mysterious Voice
DungeonReminderData_Content_1011001	What are you lot doing! Stupid idiots!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1011002	Kaeya
DungeonReminderData_Content_1011002	You again! Just who are you? Get outta here!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1002002	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1002002	But it seems there is no road left to take...
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1002003	Amber
DungeonReminderData_Content_1002003	It's easy, just burn off these vines and you're done!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1002004	Amber
DungeonReminderData_Content_1002004	It's decided!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1002005	Amber
DungeonReminderData_Content_1002005	Knights of Favonius tactics, the use of fire, have you learnt how to use them yet?
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1002006	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1002006	Have you got it down?
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1002007	Amber
DungeonReminderData_Content_1002007	You clearly have a bit of flair if you can keep up with me.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1002008	Amber
DungeonReminderData_Content_1002008	If you have any more trouble, you can always come find me!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1031001	Amber
DungeonReminderData_Content_1031001	It's so tall... Seems like there's something up there.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1031002	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1031002	But how do we get across?
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1031003	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1031003	Isn't this...a "Pyro Monument"?
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1031004	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1031004	If we hit it with some powerful Pyro attack, we might trigger it!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1031005	Amber
DungeonReminderData_Content_1031005	Looking at this color... Yes, it's a <color=#00E1FFFF>fire monument</color>, which means I can give it a go!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1031006	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1031006	 
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1032001	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1032001	Dragon's breath! Is that where the power is coming from?
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1032002	Amber
DungeonReminderData_Content_1032002	Great, let's smash it!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1032003	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1032003	Oh~ Well we can't fall behind either, {主角名}!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1032004	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1032004	Once I deal to it, I can head back to the library, right?
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1013001	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1013001	With this many monsters defending the treasure chest, it could get a little tricky this time round
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1013002	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1013002	Don't worry, I'm better at dealing with monsters all bunched up together!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1013003	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1013003	Just let me teach you how to use lightning
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1014001	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1014001	One touch of my lightning skills can cause fire monsters to burn up
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1015001	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1015001	Not only that, but lightning can also slow wet enemies
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1016001	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1016001	If you know how to use lightning, you'll be much stronger
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1017001	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1017001	Uh-oh, they're going to rush us
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1017002	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1017002	Look closely at your surroundings, and bring them into the water
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1017003	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1017003	Release a lightning skill against monsters in the water, and they'll be paralyzed
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1018001	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1018001	Nicely done! You're a natural. Let's go grab that treasure chest!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1018002	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1018002	If we're all done here, we can use the Teleportation Stone over there to go home!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1019001	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1019001	Darn it! We've startled more monsters, they're headed our way
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1019002	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1019002	Take note of their formation, look for a weak spot!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1021001	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1021001	Those soldiers must have gone into the ruins.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1021002	Barbara
DungeonReminderData_Content_1021002	Let's head inside and see!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1022001	Barbara
DungeonReminderData_Content_1022001	Oh no! The soldier lying just ahead seems to be injured. Quick, let's go check on him!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1023001	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1023001	There's next to no trace of any Hilichurl having lived here. Seems they haven't been here long.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1023002	Barbara
DungeonReminderData_Content_1023002	Or perhaps it's because of Stormterror. The Hilichurl tribes are getting bolder
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1024001	Barbara
DungeonReminderData_Content_1024001	Oh, yes! I found another survivor!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1025001	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1025001	Don't force yourself. If you're too tired we can rest a while just up ahead
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1026001	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1026001	Seems there's some sort of noise coming from deeper inside... Is it... chanting?
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1027001	Barbara
DungeonReminderData_Content_1027001	The sound is getting louder, they're definitely inside!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1028001	Barbara
DungeonReminderData_Content_1028001	Even here the Hilichurl have taken hostages!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1028002	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1028002	Quiet, don't let them hear you. Seems we still have a chance to take them by surprise...
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1029001	Barbara
DungeonReminderData_Content_1029001	This dungeon is absolutely huge! I wonder who built it...
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1029002	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1029002	The last remaining memory of a long forgotten civilization. Perhaps one of the archaeologists will know more about it.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1030001	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1030001	And just like that, a <color=#00E1FFFF>wind column</color>. Perhaps we can use it to fly across!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1033001	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1033001	Where are you off to? Don't go running away, we're not done yet!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1033002	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1033002	This area has been sealed off by some mysterious power. We're not going to be able to force our way through
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1033003	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1033003	Are you trying to get yourself locked up?
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1034001	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1034001	Oh! Paimon felt it! The Anemo Slimes left by Stormterror are definitely there!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1035001	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1035001	That was too close!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1035002	Kaeya
DungeonReminderData_Content_1035002	True, I can deal with flames, but I still have nothing on <color=#00E1FFFF>people with Hydro abilities</color>
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1036001	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1036001	Is that the thing the Stormterror uses to gain its power?
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1036002	Kaeya
DungeonReminderData_Content_1036002	Possibly. Let's get to it.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1037001	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1037001	Chain damage can be set off between Electro-Charged opponents.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1037002	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1037002	The electrical discharge caused by friction is only a little less shocking than love at first sight.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1037003	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1037003	And my Ultimate is at its finest in these kinds of environments.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1038002	Kaeya
DungeonReminderData_Content_1038002	I'm not too sure, but I think if I <color=#00E1FFFF>move carefully</color>, I should be able to do it!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1039001	Mysterious Voice
DungeonReminderData_Content_1039001	Aldon Abramig Od Quasaba
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1039002	Mysterious Voice
DungeonReminderData_Content_1039002	Ika yaya！Upa sada kundala
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1039003	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1039003	That's that sound?
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1039004	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1039004	The wind doesn't reach this far, but it seems there is a wind current over to the right!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1039005	Kaeya
DungeonReminderData_Content_1039005	If I'm not mistaken, the end of the temple should be there.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1039006	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1039006	Wait... why?
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1039007	Kaeya
DungeonReminderData_Content_1039007	Experience.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1039008	Kaeya
DungeonReminderData_Content_1039008	...The kind of experience you get after years of looking after others.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1039009	Kaeya
DungeonReminderData_Content_1039009	It's the sound of Hilichurl footsteps. Get ready for a fight.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1039010	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1039010	It's the sound of Hilichurl footsteps. Get ready for a fight.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1039011	Kaeya
DungeonReminderData_Content_1039011	I can hear Hilichurl footsteps. Leave the fighting to me, you focus on protecting yourselves.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1039012	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1039012	It seems he didn't hear... How strange, {主角名}...
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1041001	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1041001	I knew it. There are strong elemental reactions at the end of this temple.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1041002	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1041002	Paimon, are you able to float across?
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1041003	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1041003	I can't do much even if I get there.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1041004	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1041004	Good point. We'd better start looking for a way to get to it then.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1041005	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1041005	I need to give it a good go too.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1041011	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1041011	Let's head up on this wind.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1041021	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1041021	It's a wind current! Seems the road heads that way too. Let's go!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1041022	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1041022	Oh, you want to know about this gem?
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1041023	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1041023	You're kidding... You're seriously asking? This is a Vision.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1041024	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1041024	It's used by the chosen to draw out elemental power.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1041025	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1041025	In terms of mysticism, I suppose you could call it a magical device of sorts.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1041026	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1041026	What... You've never ever seen a Vision. Where are you even from...
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1041027	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1041027	Is it a Hilichurl with some level of reasonable intelligence?
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1041028	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1041028	No, I doubt it. After all, Hilichurl aren't exactly known for their smarts.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1041029	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1041029	And you, you'd more or less qualify to be a magister's apprentice.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1041031	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1041031	Hey, a treasure chest, where did that come from...
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1041041	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1041041	Leave it to me.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1041042	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1041042	When it comes to Wet enemies, I've got them covered.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1041051	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1041051	Going on that feeling, I say we overload them and take 'em down one by one.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1041061	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1041061	Oh crap, they're coming for us.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1041071	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1041071	With wet enemies, just one zap of lightning has them entirely paralyzed.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1041072	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1041072	It's a wind current. Let's head up from here.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1041073	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1041073	Of course, if we get wet then we're in the exact same danger.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1041081	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1041081	So many monsters! This'll be tough to handle. 
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1041091	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1041091	Water! We can use it to set off chain damage between enemies.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1041092	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1041092	Electrifying wet enemies will help to do lots more damage.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1041093	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1041093	It's an "Electro Monument." No wonder.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1041094	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1041094	Let me try to activate it with the power of lightning. Watch out.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1041101	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1041101	My element is at its best in these environments.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1041102	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1041102	In water, lightning is best for taking out large groups of enemies!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1041111	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1041111	Just ahead is a Storm Crystal.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1041112	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1041112	Break it and we can head home and relax.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1041113	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1041113	The thought of kicking back and relax has me all fired up!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1041114	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1041114	Once we arrive at that temple we'll be done, right?
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1042001	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1042001	Wow, it really is spectacular, but I don't think we'll get through easy on these wind currents
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1042002	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1042002	Hey hey hey! We can't go that way yet!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1042003	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_1042003	Hey wait! Not that way!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1042011	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1042011	You're passed the first one! Keep going!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1042021	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1042021	We need to find a place to rest. Looks like we won't be able to finish this in one go.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1042031	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1042031	The end is just ahead. Watch out! There's a Hilichurl lining you up!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1042041	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1042041	Argh, this is really hard
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1042051	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1042051	There's a wind current we can ride!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1042052	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1042052	There's a door off to the side, not sure what's behind it
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1042061	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1042061	There's a wind current we can ride!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1042062	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1042062	Oh, looks like that opened that side door
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1042071	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1042071	Looks like we can fly across
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1042081	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1042081	Argh! A Slime just dropped in out of nowhere!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1042091	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1042091	I think I just heard a door open.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1042092	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1042092	So it turns out we can get there quickly from here
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1042093	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1042093	There's a switch over here, let's see what it does
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1042094	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1042094	Wow, look! Lots of Water Amber appeared down below!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1042095	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1042095	Well that's finally resolved. Let's head to our last objective!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1042096	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1042096	Watch out!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1042097	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1042097	What!? There's two of them! Be careful!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_1042098	Lisa
DungeonReminderData_Content_1042098	The movement platform is over there! (Lacking a movement platform and cutscene performance)
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10060101	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_10060101	That guy over there seems familiar, I feel like I've seen him before. Let's head over and ask him!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10060201	Jean
DungeonReminderData_Content_10060201	Hmmm... The <color=#00E1FFFF>doors on both sides</color> are open, but how do we get in?
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10060202	Amber
DungeonReminderData_Content_10060202	It's no problem for me
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10060301	 
DungeonReminderData_Content_10060301	Wise adventurer, congratulations on beating the thorn maze
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10060401	 
DungeonReminderData_Content_10060401	Everything you see before you is the key to<color=#00E1FFFF>starting your trial</color>. Once you are ready you can begin your journey
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10060501	 
DungeonReminderData_Content_10060501	Congratulations on completing the first round of trials. Take a rest, and when you are ready, you can <color=#00E1FFFF>start the second round</color>.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10060601	 
DungeonReminderData_Content_10060601	Trying to <color=#00E1FFFF>kill Water monsters</color> is pointless. Here, because of the Ice Slimes, Water monsters will keep <color=#00E1FFFF>spawning</color>.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10060602	Amber
DungeonReminderData_Content_10060602	These Water monsters are so annoying! It's because of them that we keep getting frozen
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10060603	Jean
DungeonReminderData_Content_10060603	Don't fret, let me think of something. Perhaps we can <color=#00E1FFFF>blow the Water monsters into the thorns to slow their advance</color>
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10060701	 
DungeonReminderData_Content_10060701	Nice work! Well done on passing the second round of trials. Are you ready to take on the <color=#00E1FFFF>Final Trial</color>?
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10060801	 
DungeonReminderData_Content_10060801	Wow! You've left such an impression on me! Go. Go and claim your reward for completing the final trial!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10060901	 
DungeonReminderData_Content_10060901	Wow! You've conquered the hidden trial! I can't believe it! You are truly deserving of this treasure! Go and claim it!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10060902	 
DungeonReminderData_Content_10060902	Fearless warrior! Should you wish to grow stronger, don't hesitate to come back and take on the challenge again!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10050101	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_10050101	Who's that over there? Let's go see what he's up to!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10050201	 
DungeonReminderData_Content_10050201	Welcome! Brave adventurer! Let's see what rewards you can reap today!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10050301	 
DungeonReminderData_Content_10050301	The paths of the First Trial are open to you. Take your pick! <color=#00E1FFFF>Show your courage and take your chosen path</color> to move forward.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10050401	 
DungeonReminderData_Content_10050401	Ah! You've chosen the <color=#00E1FFFF>Fire Trial</color>! Go forth, your trial awaits you!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10050501	 
DungeonReminderData_Content_10050501	Ah! You've chosen the <color=#00E1FFFF>Ice Trial</color>! Go forth, your trial awaits you!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10050601	 
DungeonReminderData_Content_10050601	Ah! You've chosen the <color=#00E1FFFF>Lightning Trial</color>! Go forth, your trial awaits you!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10050701	 
DungeonReminderData_Content_10050701	That wasn't easy! The paths of the Second Trial are open to you. Which will you pick? <color=#00E1FFFF>Move forth down your chosen path</color> to proceed.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10050801	 
DungeonReminderData_Content_10050801	Ah! You've chosen <color=#00E1FFFF>Fire Trial — Fury</color>! Go forth and take on the challenge!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10050901	 
DungeonReminderData_Content_10050901	Ah! You've chosen <color=#00E1FFFF>Fire Trial — Hurdle</color>! Go forth and take on the challenge!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10051001	 
DungeonReminderData_Content_10051001	Ah! You've chosen <color=#00E1FFFF>Fire Trial — Symbiosis</color>! Go forth and take on the challenge!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10051101	 
DungeonReminderData_Content_10051101	Ah! You've chosen <color=#00E1FFFF>Ice Trial — Fury</color>! Go forth and take on the challenge!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10051201	 
DungeonReminderData_Content_10051201	Ah! You've chosen <color=#00E1FFFF>Ice Trial — Hurdle</color>! Go forth and take on the challenge!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10051301	 
DungeonReminderData_Content_10051301	Ah! You've chosen <color=#00E1FFFF>Ice Trial — Symbiosis</color>! Go forth and take on the challenge!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10051401	 
DungeonReminderData_Content_10051401	Ah! You've chosen <color=#00E1FFFF>Lightning Trial — Fury</color>! Go forth and take on the challenge!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10051501	 
DungeonReminderData_Content_10051501	Ah! You've chosen <color=#00E1FFFF>Lightning Trial — Hurdle</color>! Go forth and take on the challenge!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10051601	 
DungeonReminderData_Content_10051601	Ah! You've chosen <color=#00E1FFFF>Lightning Trial — Symbiosis</color>! Go forth and take on the challenge!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10051701	 
DungeonReminderData_Content_10051701	Convincing performance! These treasure chests are all yours. You're welcome back to the challenge any time!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10051801	 
DungeonReminderData_Content_10051801	Take a quick break. The next challenge is about to begin!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10051802	 
DungeonReminderData_Content_10051802	Taking on the Anemo Orbs right now is pointless. Perhaps, try a different approach...
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10051803	 
DungeonReminderData_Content_10051803	Woah! Two more monsters! Definitely need to be careful!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10051804	 
DungeonReminderData_Content_10051804	The Anemo Orbs' invincibility has worn off. Give them everything you've got! Take 'em out to win!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10051805	 
DungeonReminderData_Content_10051805	Take on the Hero Trial above, brave adventurer!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10051806	 
DungeonReminderData_Content_10051806	I feel uneasy... Be careful.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20010001	 
DungeonReminderData_Content_20010001	There's wind currents connecting the platforms!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20010002	 
DungeonReminderData_Content_20010002	The wind currents connecting the platforms are getting weaker...
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20010003	 
DungeonReminderData_Content_20010003	The wind currents connecting the platforms have died off
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20010004	Venti
DungeonReminderData_Content_20010004	Look! There are <color=#00E1FFFF>two shining spots</color> on Dvalin!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20010005	Venti
DungeonReminderData_Content_20010005	That's the poisonous blood clots coagulated on the wound...
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20010006	Venti
DungeonReminderData_Content_20010006	The Abyss Order focused on cursing the wound. That's what corrupts Dvalin's mind.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20010007	Venti
DungeonReminderData_Content_20010007	To save Dvalin, we first have to get rid of those <color=#00E1FFFF>blood clots</color>.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20010008	Venti
DungeonReminderData_Content_20010008	I can converge and condense Anemo powers in the storm, for you to unleash them.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20010009	Venti
DungeonReminderData_Content_20010009	This is a tactic that can only be used under special conditions.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20010010	Venti
DungeonReminderData_Content_20010010	Anemo, or Wind, can barely scratch Dvalin the Stormterror...
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20010011	Venti
DungeonReminderData_Content_20010011	So let's aim at those shining blood clots!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20010012	Abyss Order
DungeonReminderData_Content_20010012	Following like nasty rats... how annoying.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20010013	Abyss Order
DungeonReminderData_Content_20010013	You can't stop the Abyss.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20010014	Abyss Order
DungeonReminderData_Content_20010014	Take them down.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20010015	Abyss Order
DungeonReminderData_Content_20010015	The power of Dvalin... is limitless! Hahaha!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20010016	Venti
DungeonReminderData_Content_20010016	Those monsters are annoying... Let's not waste any time and keep firing.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20010017	Venti
DungeonReminderData_Content_20010017	Good, let's clean out the <color=#00E1FFFF>poisonous blood</color>now!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20010018	Venti
DungeonReminderData_Content_20010018	We've gotten rid of them for now! Keep firing!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20010019	Venti
DungeonReminderData_Content_20010019	Humph... Don't have enough energy. Dvalin is getting away!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20010020	Venti
DungeonReminderData_Content_20010020	Darn! The Abyss Mages have disturbed the elemental flow!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20010021	Venti
DungeonReminderData_Content_20010021	Try to <color=#00E1FFFF>evade</color> their attacks while <color=#00E1FFFF>accumulating energy</color>!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20010101	Mysterious Voice
DungeonReminderData_Content_20010101	Brave adventurer. Up ahead is a forbidden land, for it is the cursed <color=#00E1FFFF>Fog Maze</color>
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20010102	Mysterious Voice
DungeonReminderData_Content_20010102	Sacrifice the spirits of <color=#00E1FFFF>100</color> monsters to me, and I shall <color=#00E1FFFF>open the door to the treasure</color> for you.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20010201	Mysterious Voice
DungeonReminderData_Content_20010201	The monsters you killed have <color=#00E1FFFF>respawned</color>, and have become <color=#00E1FFFF>even stronger</color>!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20010301	Mysterious Voice
DungeonReminderData_Content_20010301	Ah! This area's treasure chests have been unsealed, and are now yours!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20010401	Mysterious Voice
DungeonReminderData_Content_20010401	<color=#00E1FFFF>25</color> spirits. Not bad. But you still have a long way to go!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20010402	Mysterious Voice
DungeonReminderData_Content_20010402	As a reward, I have placed a little something for you before the treasure door. I'm sure you will like it.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20010501	Mysterious Voice
DungeonReminderData_Content_20010501	You've sacrificed <color=#00E1FFFF>50</color> spirits! Do you wish to go on?
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20010502	Mysterious Voice
DungeonReminderData_Content_20010502	I've left some incentive before the treasure door. I know you won't be disappointed!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20010601	Mysterious Voice
DungeonReminderData_Content_20010601	<color=#00E1FFFF>75</color> spirits! Oh, now you've woken the defender of the maze
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20010602	Mysterious Voice
DungeonReminderData_Content_20010602	<color=#00E1FFFF>Look for the defender in the maze</color>! If you defeat him, you will have enough spirits to open the treasure door!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20010603	Mysterious Voice
DungeonReminderData_Content_20010603	Of course, you can also choose to leave. You can collect your reward from in front of the treasure door.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20010701	Mysterious Voice
DungeonReminderData_Content_20010701	<color=#00E1FFFF>100</color> spirits! <color=#00E1FFFF>100</color> spirits! I haven't been this satisfied in so long!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20010702	Mysterious Voice
DungeonReminderData_Content_20010702	Go. I've already opened the treasure door. These legendary treasures are all yours now!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20010703	Mysterious Voice
DungeonReminderData_Content_20010703	You're welcome back again any time!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20010302	Mysterious Voice
DungeonReminderData_Content_20010302	Should you come back, the monsters here will be even <color=#00E1FFFF>more difficult</color>!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20011001	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_20011001	There are three stone seats here, each corresponding to a different <color=#00E1FFFF>element</color>. They may be hiding some sort of secret!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20011002	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_20011002	Woah! Seems you got a reaction! There are still two more <color=#00E1FFFF>elemental monuments</color> that must also have hidden secrets. Wanna give them a go?
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20011003	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_20011003	Perhaps if all are opened, we might find something! Check out the last <color=#00E1FFFF>elemental monument</color> and see if we can get it open!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20011004	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_20011004	There are three <color=#00E1FFFF>Pyro</color> monuments here, they may be hiding something secret!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20011005	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_20011005	There are three <color=#00E1FFFF>Electro</color> monuments here, they may be hiding something secret!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20011006	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_20011006	Seems like these monuments will deactivate automatically after a while. Perhaps they only work when activated at the same time?
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_40010101	 
DungeonReminderData_Content_40010101	Are you ready to take on the challenge? My monsters are already stirring!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_40010201	 
DungeonReminderData_Content_40010201	You barely have time to breathe, but the next wave of monsters is already upon you!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_40010301	 
DungeonReminderData_Content_40010301	You're impressive, but do you have what it takes to take me on?
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_40010401	 
DungeonReminderData_Content_40010401	Oh! You are powerful! But we've already got you trapped!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10010101	Amber
DungeonReminderData_Content_10010101	Oh no! The horn!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10010102	Amber
DungeonReminderData_Content_10010102	The fighting must have got them riled up.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10010103	Amber
DungeonReminderData_Content_10010103	This is why I've prepared my secret weapon: <color=#00E1FFFF>Explosive Puppet "Baron Bunny"</color>!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10010201	Amber
DungeonReminderData_Content_10010201	Are those...<color=#00E1FFFF>explosive barrels</color> over there?
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10010202	Amber
DungeonReminderData_Content_10010202	Well...one shot should be able to blow them up.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10010301	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_10010301	Seems the road ahead requires us to get on that platform.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10010302	Kaeya
DungeonReminderData_Content_10010302	Isn't this an...<color=#00E1FFFF>elemental monument</color>?
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10010303	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_10010303	Seems like it contains something...
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10010304	Kaeya
DungeonReminderData_Content_10010304	Yea, seems these old monuments can be activated with the corresponding <color=#00E1FFFF>element</color>
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10010305	Kaeya
DungeonReminderData_Content_10010305	Judging by the color, this should be an <color=#00E1FFFF>Ice monument</color>. Let me take care of it.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_10010306	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_10010306	
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20020101	Venti
DungeonReminderData_Content_20020101	With the help of the best bard in the world, we are now on par with Dvalin.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20020102	Venti
DungeonReminderData_Content_20020102	But first, let me be clear...
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20020103	Venti
DungeonReminderData_Content_20020103	Even after hundreds of years unattended, the teeth and claws of Dvalin are still dangerous.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20020201	Venti
DungeonReminderData_Content_20020201	A-ha, this is Dvalin's ace in the hole: Caelestinum Finale Termini!
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20020202	Venti
DungeonReminderData_Content_20020202	Winds shall heed my call. Ride my wind currents between ruin platforms, and dodge Dvalin's attacks.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20020203	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_20020203	... This dragon has a strange taste in naming.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20020204	Venti
DungeonReminderData_Content_20020204	I named it for him just now.
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20020205	Paimon
DungeonReminderData_Content_20020205	 ...
DungeonReminderData_Speaker_20020301	Venti
DungeonReminderData_Content_20020301	Now is the time! Target the tainted blood clots on the neck!
