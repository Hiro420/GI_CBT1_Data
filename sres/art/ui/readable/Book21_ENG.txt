In the myths of ages past, every living being in this world had their own kingdoms.
Mondstadt was a forest at that age and time, a playground of the boars.
In the forest was the boar kingdom, where everybody lived happily under the reign of the King Boar.
The King had a lovely young daughter, who had the prettiest snout, the whitest tusks, and the smoothest fur in the whole kingdom.
The Princess, beautiful and kind, gave the juiciest and sweetest fruits to her subjects every day.
From sweet and sour raspberries, crisp apples to delicious tree mushrooms, the Princess always shared them first with her friends.
Every boar in the kingdom adored their King and Princess, and every day they praised them so:
"Oink, oink! Bless our King! As long as he reigns over us, we will never starve!"
"Oink, oink! Bless the gentle Anemo Archon for giving our King such a kind and polite Princess!"
