In the boundless sea of dandelions that existed nowhere, I watched the dandelions took off with the lightest push from a breeze. I suddenly knew the answer to that question that lingered on my mind for years.
"So this is where all the fox have gone to when they were being chased by hunters."
I thought.
"What a beautiful place."
But when I began teaching the little fox to speak our common tongue, my heart always felt empty, like there were winds blowing inside of me.
When talking to her and looking into her eyes that resembled gemstones in a lake, I always felt that I wasn't speaking to the fox, but to the girl who I loved years ago instead.
That was why I felt a bit depressed when she was around me. It was like your someone you love had a baby; You may still get along, but you'd never feel the same again.
But at the thought of her promise - if I succeeded in teaching her child to speak the common tongue...
"I shall impart our magic tricks to you when the time comes."
Seeing how she promised to me solemnly made me feel extra driven.
Could I morph into a flying bird once I've mastered the tricks? How high would I fly? I could also morph into a fish and swim to the Musk Reef, which I've never been to.
"I can also hunt using magic," I couldn't contain my excitement. "No more meatless carrot stews."
I lost track of how long I stayed in the dandelion sea that swayed gently with the wind.
It was also partly for the reason that the little one was such a fast learner! I taught him not only the language, but everything I knew in one package, including calculating numbers, growing carrots, changing windows, and sharpening knives.
We chat when we took breaks.
"Why must you learn human speech?"
He answered swiftly:
"So that I could befriend the humans, of course!"
I continued to ask:
"Why would you want befriend the humans?"
He dropped his gaze.
