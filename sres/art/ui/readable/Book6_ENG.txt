Friends of Mondstadt, let us revel! Drink to your heart's content!
The day came when Barbatos answered her devotion.
The Anemo Archon sought her fiery hair and ascended to her position.
"Every being deserves a name," the spirit grinned.
"To weave your fair name into a song I yearn,"
"I seek nothing but your friendship in return."
The girl happily reciprocated, her fear were swiftly dissipated.
 
And so, to the battlefield she marched in Barbatos' singing voice,
For the demonic dragon fled from her might did the people rejoice.
Corpulent Magnates crawled under tables at such a valiant sight.
"Mondstadt is freedom," the winds sang for their people in delight.
Lonely forest breeze converged, jointly they overthrew the tyrant's tower from the sky.
Broken free from shackles at last, the young lion stood in winds with her head held high.
 
And so, the fiery head dame won herself prestigious fame.
Her heart swell with appreciation to sing by the Anemo Archon's side.
No words of gratitude should you utter, yet Barbatos replied:
"You conduct what is to come in your song.
"You have entrusted me with your friendship and your name.
"To praise your freedom, my songs came."
 
Friends, let us drink some more!
Drink to what flowed the freedom of Mondstadt,
For when days become nights and faces pain in despair.
Never omit the heroic tales of Vennessa with flaming hair;
Never cease to pursue freedom even when the land is bare!
