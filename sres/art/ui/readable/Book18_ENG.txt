"Vera's Melancholy - Part 9 - Death Awaits in Abyssal Waves"
As Vera and Sachi grew up, they chemistry between the four changed in delicate and inexplicable ways.
"Enough with excuses," Sachi said to Ike. "Vera will not cease pursuing you even if you could never reciprocate her feelings."
Ike was a symbol of distant lands, a metaphor for the unknown and novelty. A brave bird would never nest, but forever adrift in the winds of admiration.
Ike struck back with an advice, "No matter how you put it, being a thousand years old makes you an old chap."
"Then we are of the matching age," the Princess merrily chipped in on their conversation.
 
When Sachi finally mustered the courage to declare his love, he was met with the most dreadful fate.
Remember the ancient sword that Ike and Vera received from the old ones when they first met? It was what Ike needed to propel destiny forward! But now, Vera had her finger slit by its blade, and the malicious archaic viruses sapped her life clean!
 
"It's all your fault!" Sachi grabbed Ike by the collar. If the tragedy had not happened, Ike would only have smirked, for he was a gentle soul. But this time, he slapped Sarge's hand away.
"Don't you know how to rewind time? Please! Do it to save Vera!" Even the Princess begged.
"You don't understand. Only the future can save the past, not the other way around." Ike bit his lips until blood came crawling down.
 
"A local myth speaks of a Silver Age when people enjoyed seemingly endless childhood that could last up to two hundred years. This only made their short maturity a pain to bear."
To the others, their childhood have become relics of the past, yet their youth are forever beyond their reach.
