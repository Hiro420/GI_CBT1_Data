Vera's Melancholy - Part 1 - Endless Days in Infinite Worlds
"There are times when I think to myself... There's nothing to do in this tiny village. What a dull place to live in."
This wasn't the first time that Vera, a country girl who grew up in the small village of Delphi, complained with a frown. She was lying on the hillside near the village with her eyes closed, feeling the breeze of early summer.
"Then where in this world would you not consider dull?" Her buddy Sachi asked curiously.
Vera sat up with her body leaning forward.
"I believe on the other side of the starry seas is a planet inhabited by Archons who can answer all prayers and wishes, and everyone bearing a wish is on a journey to get there. I believe, in our universe, there is a world currently in a war against doomsday, where the noble and elegant souls of fourteen Valkyries burn bright, if only for a brief but magnificent moment..."
"You've been reading too many of those weird fantasy novels."
"But... this village really IS dull. Is it truly impossible for anything fun to happen here?"
"Funny you should say that, a new family did move into our village recently..."
"Novelty and fun aren't the same!"
Even after saying that, Vera decided a visit was in order. Sachi, however, remembered the family rules, and walked back home for dinner.
 
...
Vera gave the door to the newcomer's abode a light shove. Much to her surprise, it wasn't locked.
"Anybody home?"
At this very moment, the cupboard in the living room suddenly opened itself, and a black-haired boy wearing glasses jumped out of it, followed by a tentacle oozing blue slime.
"Make way! Tal, why did you let a stranger in?"
The black-haired boy gently pushed Vera out of his way, and picked up an axe by the door.
"You have left me with no choice. Since you have seen everything, all I can do now is——"
The biggest crisis in Vera's life?!
