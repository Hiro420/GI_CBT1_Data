No one knew what chemistry occurred in the pup's stomach, but Woobaka's curse magically came into effect!
Because of the curse, the pup's heart was pierced and frozen by an icicle. The pup became cold and mean ever since, and when other animals cared for him, he would only repay with the harshest words or the most saddening deeds! In the end, every animal hated him.
From then on, every wolf in the forest spoke of the pup in this way:
"Woof, what a selfish wolf he is! Such an obnoxious kid."
"Woof, woof, what a heartless wolf he is! Let us stay away from him."
The pup lost his friends one by one. The forest welcomed the lonely pup no more, so he had no choice but to head north.
The blizzard blew in the northern tundra and kept creatures away. But with his heart already frozen solid, the pup was no longer afraid of winter.
He decided to settle down in these lands and became the lone wolf that roamed the tundra.
