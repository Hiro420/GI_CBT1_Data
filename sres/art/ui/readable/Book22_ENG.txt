North to the Boar Forest was a frozen tundra.
The playful Barbatos had not reached the lands, so they remained covered by ice and snow.
Every creature who walks on those lands would risk freezing their paws and hooves off.
"It's cold, too cold! It's freezing! My claws are going to chap apart due of the cold!"
Even the bravest, and strongest King Boar could not withstand the frigid tundra.
"Oink, oink, oink! My snout has been frozen purple!"
There lived but a lone wolf pup.
 
(There are childish words written at the bottom: "dada, why does the little woof has good paws in the cold")
