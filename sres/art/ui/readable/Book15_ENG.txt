A collection of Hilichurl poetry compiled by the Mondstadt ecologist Jacob Musk. To complete this book, Musk traveled across the continent to visit every Hilichurl tribe, and went so far as to venture deep into Hilichurl settlements to deeply involve himself in their lives. Musk is praised as the "Poet Laureate of the Hilichurl Language" for this book, but it was evident that neither the scholar himself nor the Hilichurls were particularly fond of such honor. Jacob Musk, though enthusiastic for Hilichurl studies, loathed to be equated to them even in his late years.
 
The first song:
Mi muhe ye
Mi biat ye
Biat ye dada
	
Muhe dada
 
Quite possibly a battle song sang by the Hilichurls before brawling. According to my observation, when two or more Hilichurls are present, they would engage in a frantic brawl after singing this vulgar song.
 
The second song:
Eleka mimi-a-Domu
Mita domu-a-dada
La-la-laLa-la-la
La-la-la
Mimi mosi ye mita
 
The song was sang by Hilichurls as they danced around totem poles. It is speculated to be a tribal hymn with an upbeat tone, which could usually be heard at their carnivals.
 
The third song:
Mi muhe mita nye
Mi muhe mita nye
Muhe nye
Muhe nye
Gusha
Biat, gusha
 
A brooding Hilichurl song I heard when exchanging with an elderly Hilichurl. Although I do not yet understand the literal meaning of the poem, the overflowing grief that of the song is enough to surprise the best poets in my birthplace (despite such praise, I must admit the acrid smells coming from elderly Hilichurls were just as brooding).
