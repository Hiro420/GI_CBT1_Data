It was only when I felt off did I realize that I had become a dandelion puff-ball.
Even if I wanted to protest, the dandelion had no mouth nor tongue for me to make such a sound. There was nothing I could have done but helplessly watch the giant picked my plant from the ground, gently using her thumb and index finger.
"Dandelion, Dandelion, ride the wind to a faraway land."
The fox chanted.
And then with a blow, the dandelion puff-balls began to dance in the air. I was caught in a storm and flew to the distant sky.
The swirling made my head dizzy. Those eyes that glistened like gemstones in the lake left me along with my consciousness and the wish that I heard the fox made.
"The Anemo Archon, I beg of you to turn us into humans! For only then can we be safe from the hunting bows and knives of the humans."
...
When I woke up, I discovered myself in the woods behind my village.
The woods were full of lush trees, and at the center of the woods was a small lake.
The lake was like the glass windows of the Mondstadt Cathedral, for they were all crystal clear and they shimmered under the sun.
The sun shone through the leaves and left what looked like fragmented gemstones on the lake water. It was really something.
On that day the weather was cool. I was hunting in the forest, and when I walked to the lake. The shimmering water somehow reminded me of a girl I loved a long time ago.
Couldn't remember what she was like, but her eyes must have looked like the water, glittering like fragmented gemstones.
Yeah. I must have lost myself and fallen asleep unknowingly as I stared at the sparkling lake.
