After venturing though the bitter cold and the swirling storms, the Princess finally met the pup.
The pup was covered in ice, his bright blue eyes now dim, and he even forgot how to bark.
"Aroo! You have come at the right moment, for I haven't had lunch yet!"
Hearing his words, the kind Princess could not help but shed tears. Her warm tears seemed to have melted a little ice at the tip of the pup's heart.
"Aroo! Why are you crying?"
"Aroo, aroo! You are going to starve here, and I have never seen such misery in my kingdom!"
"I will sacrifice my everything to feed your hungry belly!"
The pup was stupefied by her words.
"Arooooooo! Miss, you must be mad! No one has ever dare say such things to me!"
But when the pup saw determination in her eyes, his frozen heart cracked some more.
"Nope! That's why..."
"I will sacrifice two of my family who are the wisest and most caring just to feed you! It is for our friendship!"
The Fox knew what horror she meant and attempted to run, but he was pinned to the ground by the pup and the Princess. Grandpa Turtle was so frightened by the sight that, he retrieved into his shell!
The pup and the Princess had a delicious meal out in the snow. After finding a cave, they picked mushrooms, built a fire with moss, and had a tasty turtle soup.
The pup felt the delight of sharing and making friends for the first time. His frozen heart melted into happy tears.
The Princess took the pup by its paw, and the two merrily returned to their home.
