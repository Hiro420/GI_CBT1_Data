When our perceptions are unfettered by Archons and churches, we shall learn that in northern Teyvat, the people of Mondstadt preserved their culture as decades ago, even after Barbatos the Anemo Archon has concealed himself. When we observe the daily lives of the people of Mondstadt from a higher perspective, it is evident that the people share a carefree nature, which mostly stemmed from their bountiful and pleasant living conditions. The surplus grain produced became their source of brews, and the brews further nourished their breezy temperament. Above all, the Anemo Archon had never tought them how to make wine and revel.
But I do not intend to make my readers think that we could do without Archons. On the contrary, say, if Barbatos had not guided the warm monsoons to Mondstadt with his divine powers, would Mondstadt still be so bountiful as to produce the brews that it does?
The answer would be no. Mondstadt is an inland city and would have struggled to provide for itself if not for the grace of Barbatos. If we look back through history, we learn that Mondstadt is situated on a land that was once frozen, where the living conditions were harsh and brewing would be virtually impossible. It was the power of Barbatos that changed everything.
A cumbersome preface indeed, but I hope that my readers keep a vision in mind when reading my humble book: it is the power of Archons that created our living environment. On such premise, we should be clearly aware that the true element that shapes our thinking, logic, culture, philosophy and aesthetics is not the Archons themselves, but the objective environment that exists around us. Similar to the title of this book, the people of Teyvat have always gone with divinity, nothing more, and nothing less.
