"Teacher, please allow me to teach you magic tricks that only I know."
Still unfamiliar with the common language, he did his best to spurt out the sentence, though not without hiccups.
He picked a little dandelion.
"Dandelion, Dandelion, ride the wind to a faraway land."
The little fox chanted.
He blew the dandelion flower and sent puff-balls flying. He then spoke in a serious tone.
"By doing so, your wishes will ride the winds and reach the Anemo Archon."
A wind blew past us and swept away many puff-balls.
"See? The Anemo Archon has just answered my wish!"
He exclaimed merrily.
"What wish did you make?"
"To become friends with my teacher."
He lowered his head abruptly.
"It must have been tiring to teach him speak your language. Our mouths are structured differently from a human's, so I must thank your for your effort."
The fox had come to us before we noticed. Her eyes were like a bottomless lake, and the little fox quietly hid himself in the grass under such gaze.
"When he has mastered my language,"
I thought.
"When he has mastered my language,"
She said softly.
