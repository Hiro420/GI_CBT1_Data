"Why must you learn human speech?"
On one occasion I asked the little fox this question.
He answered cheerfully in my language:
"So that I can befriend the humans, of course!"
"Why would you want to befriend the humans?"
As if confronted with a saddening question, he dropped his gaze.
"I saw a boy in the distant forest."
"He was dressed in gray. He looked and had eyes like a wolf." He complemented.
"I have just learned my magics then, so I was eagerly running on hind legs. Running on grass was fun! But sadly, due to height differences, a fox could not see or smell the same things that humans did."
"I'm sure my teacher could understand what happened next! When I have recollected myself, I discovered the horrible truth - I was lost."
He recalled in frustration.
In the end, he wandered to some faraway woods, and even encountered vicious monsters.
When he thought he was done for, that gray lupine boy suddenly leaped out of the forest and chased away the monsters. Without a word, he turned around and vanished into the woods.
"If I could morph into a human and speak their language, I can go look for him and become friends with him!"
He said gleefully.
I couldn't help but ask when I heard his reply:
"Am I not your friend?"
The little one answered in common tongue with a sincere expression:
"Mommy told me that you're my teacher, and we don't mix - but I'd only hurt you if I tell you that,"
He tilted his head in befuddlement. His fluffy tail patted the surrounding dandelions as he pondered over the difficult question.
"I know!"
He burst out.
"If I know something that you don't, that would make me your teacher."
"If we are both teachers, that would make us equals!"
Still unfamiliar with the common language, he did his best to spurt out the sentence, though not without hiccups.
"Teacher, please allow me to teach you magic tricks that only I know."
