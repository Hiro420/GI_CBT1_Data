The fine wines meticulously brewed by Dawn Winery have always quenched people's thirst for the finest liquor. Furthermore, the tax revenues generated by the winery alone amounted to 11.4%* of the annual expenditure of the Knights of Favonius. We are grateful for your patronage and firmly support Mondstadt and its people.

In recent years, the number of wild monsters has dropped considerably under the repression of the Knights of Favonius. The lives and property of people have been safeguarded, but wildlife have begun to proliferate inordinately without natural predators.
Although the winery has made it its highest priority secure the vineyard, an average of more than 10 <color=#FFE14BFF>fruit trees are rooted by boars</color> weekly. If such situation persists, the yield of our selection will be greatly reduced.
 
As such, Dawn Winery is recruiting for warriors like you, who are aspiring to serve to preserve the fine wines and Mondstadtu:
