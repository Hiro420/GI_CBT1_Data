The fourth song:
Celi upa celi
Sada shato lata
Kuzi unu ya zido
Unu dada
 
A song sang by Samachurls. Judging by the reactions of the chief, the song seems to bear a special philosophical meaning among the Hilichurls. It may appear ridiculous to the mainstream academic circles, and I have no intention to challenge the authoritative views, yet I feel obliged to say that whether philosophy exists among the Hilichurls is still a fascinating and romantic literary topic.
 
The fifth song:
Nini movo muhe yoyo
Nini movo mimi tomo
Lata movo mosi yoyo
Celi movo celi yoyo
 
Similar to the Mondstadt people, the wind-worshiping tribes of the Hilichurls were usually drunk and they sang songs that praise the Anemo Archon without end. This is a Hilichurl ode that can often be heard when they are inebriated.
 
The sixth song:
Unu, unu
Yaya ika kundala!
Unu, unu
Mita dada ya dala?
Unu, unu
Kuzi mita dada ye
Mita dada-a-mimi
 
A pious ode to Archons that were only sang by Hilichurls during sacrifices. When performing this ode, the Hilichurls often added percussion instruments by beating the bottoms of the weakest tribe members with planks, creating ringing and rhythmic sounds. It must have hurt.
 
The seventh song:
Mimi movo
Mimi sada
Mimi domu
Domu upa
gusha dada
 
It appeared that many Hilichurl tribes had the tradition of exchanging songs around bonfires in the moonlight. This song is one of the bonfire ballads sung by the chief at closing. At the end of the song, the chief would shout "nunu" three times, which presumably carries the meaning of "sleep."
