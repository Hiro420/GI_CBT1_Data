Friends of Mondstadt, let us revel! Drink to your heart's content!
To freedom! To the Anemo Archon!
To Vennessa, the first Knight to grace this world!
Sons and daughters of Mondstadt, may the gift from the Anemo Archon be engraved in your hearts!
No â€” To know that the gift is not freedom, but just defiance!
 
It transpired ages past.
Friends, do excuse me for improvising,
For it should be clear as day, the glory and freedom of Mondstadt
Were Born when Barbatos struck the strings dolce.
Poems sing of heroic fame,
Yet to commemorate unnamed freedom should they aim.
 
Chained by the royals, Mondstadt could but suspire,
and festivities were but vanity games of the rich,
Beyond the grasps of the ordinary.
A withering dungeon, Mondstadt was.
In slavery games the royals gayly relished;
Oblivious to their place, the inmates be.
 
A fiery-headed dame confined to a cell;
From the southern plains she did hail.
Born free but now bound by chains,
Restrained by a tyrant, her flesh remains.
Yet her pious soul never ceased to pray
For her people, for Mondstadt, for illusive freedom if she may.
