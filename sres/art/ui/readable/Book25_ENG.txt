One day, the Princess Boar heard about the pup and was deeply saddened by his story.
So the Princess asked her people about how to defrost his heart and turn him back to his former sweet self.
She asked and asked, but only the wise fox and the elderly turtle knew the answer-
"Ack-ack-ack! Only sincerity and fire could melt such evil ice. Ack-ack-ack!" The fox replied.
"Friendship demands sacrifice. No friendships come without sacrifices. I apologize for not knowing how to make funny sounds." The trustworthy grandpa turtle said.
The clever Princess figured out what she should do right away, so she dried her tears and curtsied to the two wise animals:
"Oink oink! Thank you! I would like you to go see the pup with me, so you could be the first to witness our friendship!"
When the fox and the turtle heard the Princess deigned to invite them, their hearts were full of joy. They set out with the Princess and headed for the north.
