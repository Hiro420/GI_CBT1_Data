The pup was a carefree child who had bright blue eyes and slick gray fur.
When he got angry, he looked exactly like the wolf head relief atop the Mondstadt Cathedral!
But one day, when he was hunting in the forest, he ran into the evil squirrel sorcerer Woobaka!
In the ancient lands, no beings, not even demons and dragons, were more evil than Woobaka! He despised everything nice, and swore to transform beauty into ugliness and turn light into dark.
He saw the joyful wolf and anger boiled in him! He cursed:
"Squeak! Squeak! Anger is me! I shall spike his heart with the coldest ice, and he will never know what hope means!"
With that said, Woobaka began to curse the pup with his magic.
But the rash pup bite down on him without so much as an explanation!
Woobaka was so furious that he cursed the most vulgar and insulting words he had ever spoken! The pup felt the noise coming from his mouth, and only then did he find out that he had made a mistake.
"Aroo, I'm so sorry, mister squirrel, I thought you were edible!"
The pup wished to apologize to the squirrel, but when his throat tightened and loosened, the squirrel slid to his stomach with a gulp.
